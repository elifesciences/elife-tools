Originally the “dx” separated the DOI resolver from the International DOI Foundation (IDF) website but this has changed and the IDF has already updated its recommendations 
so we are bringing ours in line with theirs. We are also recommending the use of HTTPS because it makes for more secure browsing.

The contrib MAY have following attributes:
1) equal-contrib="yes" - can only be used if an author contributed equally with another author and this attribute must be present on both their contribs.
There is no limit on the number authors who can have equal contributions and there can be separate groups of equal contribution.
This is linked to a footnote via an xref.
UPDATE: The rid should be equal-contrib1, equal-contrib2 etc to indicate which equal contrib group each author is part of. Even if there is only one
group, the number suffix is still required.
2) deceased="yes" - only used if author is now dead.
3) corresp="yes" - only used if the author is a corresponding author. There can be more than one corresponding author and there is no limit to the number

@date-type values:
preprint - The date a preprint was disseminated (electronic or print)
AM -  The date a manuscript, was published
EAM - The date a manuscript, was enhanced and re-published
VoR - The date a version of record, typically a full text XML, HTML and typeset PDF, was published
CVoR - The date a version of record, typically a full text XML, HTML and typeset PDF, was corrected (an official correction notice has been published to accompany this article)
EVoR - The date a version of record, typically a full text XML, HTML and typeset PDF, was enhanced and re-published (this article has been updated and republished, with no official correction notice)
retracted - The date an article was retracted
If an article goes through one of these processes more than once, the value should contain a suffix of “-r1”, i.e. an additional VoR enhancement would be EVor-pub-r1

            The headings used by eLife are standardised at the top level and sec is used, with a sec-type. 
            An A heading can be identified by the ID not having a further subdivision, for example S1 is the first section heading. 
            If there are B headings in this section they will have a sec id of S1-1 etc
            eLife allowed A heads for research content are:
            Introduction - sec-type="intro"
            Results - sec-type="results"
            Discussion - sec-type="discussion"
            Materials and methods - sec-type="materials|methods"
            Exceptions:
            A merged results and discussion section is acceptable:
            Results and discussion - sec-type="results|discussion"
            Discussion - sec-type="discussion"
            For Methods articles - identifiable as articles that describe models and are generally maths-heavy - the following structure is allowed: 
            Introduction sec-type="intro"
            Model - sec-type="model"
            Results - sec-type="results"

            Results - sec-type="results"
            Discussion - sec-type="discussion"
            For research advances: Authors have more flexibility with structure and sections can be combined, although the Materials and methods section
            is mandatory.
            To allow for the flexibility, a title is also appeneded to each section

            <p>This article is a guide to the tagging and display of eLife articles and will
                encompass all the elements that can possibly be contained in an eLife article.

                <p>eLife publishes the most highly influential research across the life sciences and biomedicine. 
                Before you submit your work, please note that eLife is a very selective journal that aims to publish
                work of the highest scientific standards and importance. Leading academic
                researchers evaluate new submissions and approximately two-thirds are returned to
                the authors without further peer review. See  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeLano, 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">
                    Morgan, 2016</xref>. Approximately half of the articles that are
                    selected for peer review go on to be published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brettar et al., 2004a</xref>). If other researchers publish similar
                findings after submission, this will not be a reason for rejection. The eLife
                editorial process broadly occurs in three phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turlings and Wäckers, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turlings and Wäckers, 2004b</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">

                submitting your work to eLife, please review the guidelines relating to initial
                submissions. If you have received an encouraging response to your initial
                submission, please review the guidelines relating to full submissions. If your full
                submission has been peer reviewed and you have been asked to make revisions, please
                review our guidelines for revised submissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brettar et al., 2004b</xref>).</p>

                <p>eLife publishes research of the very highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bricogne et al., 2011</xref>) standard and significance, 
                so many manuscripts are returned to the authors without in-depth peer review. During the initial submission
                phase, members of eLife’s senior editorial team rapidly assess new submissions,
                often in consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing Editors or with
                external guest editors where necessary, to identify the ones that are appropriate
                for in-depth peer review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardé and  Millar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cartwright, 2016</xref>; 
                <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chmeil, 2008</xref>). To simplify the submission process, authors should submit
                their full manuscript as a single PDF. Limited additional information is collected
                via the submission screen questions to complete the submission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brettar et al., 2004b</xref>).</p>

                            <p>A discrete three-dimensional model space was generated (represented as a

                            through for each stimulus segment in order, starting at the beginning of

                        <p>This combined parameter probability distribution was then scalar
                            multiplied with the full model space, in order to weight each of the
                            forward model columns (each corresponding to a particular parameter
                            combination) by the probability of that parameter combination being in
                            effect. The resulting weighted model space was then averaged across
                            parameter dimensions, to yield a one-dimensional (forward) probability
                            distribution, constituting an optimal prediction about the f value of
                            the next stimulus segment, provided a population change did not occur
                            before then. A probability distribution applicable if a population
                            change were to occur was calculated the same way, but without weighting
                            the forward model columns (so as to encompass every possible parameter
                            combination).</p>

                        <p>It was assumed that a population change occurred immediately prior to the
                            first stimulus segment. To infer subsequent population changes, for each
                            segment the probability of observing the present f value was compared
                            for the two probability distributions (the distribution assuming a
                            population change, and the distribution assuming no change),
                            that&#x00A0;is, P(f|c) and P(f|&#x007E;c), respectively, with c denoting
                            a population change. The probabilities were compared, in conjunction
                            with the known prior probability of a population change (1/8), using
                            Bayes&#x2019; rule, as stated in Equation 2:<disp-formula id="equ1"

                        <p>Here, P(c|f) is the chance that a population change occurred at that

                            probability of the observed f value, can be rewritten
                            P(f|c)P(c)+P(f|&#x007E;c)(1-P(c)), the above equation can be rewritten

                        <p>For each segment, the above calculation of P(c|f) was made not only with
                            respect to the immediately preceding segment, but also a number of
                            segments preceding that, up to a maximum of 4. Therefore, for segment t,
                            it was possible to conclude that a population change had occurred
                            immediately prior to t, t-1, t-2, t-3, or none of the above. A
                            population change was judged to have occurred at the time point with the
                            highest value of P(c|f), provided this value was greater than 0.5. Using
                            more than 4 lags did not appreciably alter the estimates obtained by
                            model inversion. Importantly, any retrospective inference of population
                            changes did not retrospectively alter any prior predictions generated by
                            the model (e.g. at time t, if a population change were inferred to have
                            occurred at time t-3 then the priors for t-2, t-1 and t were not
                            affected, but only the priors for t+1 onwards).</p>

                        <p>Once the above steps were worked through for each stimulus segment in
                            order, the optimal prior predictions were used to calculate the
                            perceptual inference variables of interest. Predictions themselves were
                            summarised by their mean (&#x03BC;) and precision (1/variance). Changes
                            to predictions (&#x0394;&#x00B5;) were calculated as the absolute change
                            (in octaves) in &#x03BC; from one prediction to the next. Surprise (S)
                            was calculated as the negative log probability of the observed f value
                            given the prior prediction, and prediction error (irrespective of
                            prediction precision) was calculated as the absolute difference (in
                            octaves) between the observed f value and the mean of the prior
                            prediction. Mathematically, surprise is directly proportional to
                            prediction precision multiplied by prediction error. Finally, &#x0394;f
                            was calculated as the absolute difference between the current and
                            preceding value of f.</p>

                        We propose a Bayesian scheme for BCV (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref>) that accommodates the influence of context on incentive value. BCV focuses on scenarios (i) where incentive value depends 
                        on contextual information (either represented by cues or by previous rewards) provided before options or rewards are presented, and (ii) where reward is defined 
                        by a single attribute (e.g., reward amount). To describe the basic principles of BCV, we adopt the formalism of Bayesian graphs (
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">The <italic>Shigella</italic> Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2015c</xref>) where a generative model is described by nodes or circles, representing random variables (shaded and white circles refer to observed and non-observed variables respectively), 
                        and arrows, representing causal relationships among variables. A simple generative model hypothesized by BCV is shown in
                        Figure 1A of another article (not linked here), where C represents prior beliefs about the average reward expected in a given context. 
                        Formally, this corresponds to a (Gaussian) prior belief (with mean

Generic text "No competing interests declared" is linked to all authors who do not declare a competing interest.
For the PDF rules are as follows:
1) All authors declare no competing interests: statement reads "The authors declare that no competing interests exist."
2) One or more authors declare competing interests and rest do not: "The other authors declare that no competing interests exist."
3) Only one author out of two or more declares no competing interests exist: "The other author declares that no competing interests exist."
4) One author only and there declare no competing interests: "The author declares that no competing interests exist."

                text, for example, Butcher et al, 2006. If the author provides the reference it can be added as free text to the end of the letter, however, this is not a requirement
                .</p>
