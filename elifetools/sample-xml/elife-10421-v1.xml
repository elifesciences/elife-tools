We performed crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and RNAseq on human brain, and identified nELAVL binding sites on 8681 transcripts. Using knockout mice and RNAi in human neuroblastoma cells, we showed that nELAVL intronic and 3' UTR binding regulates human RNA splicing and abundance. We validated hundreds of nELAVL targets among which were important neuronal and disease-associated transcripts, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) transcripts. We therefore investigated RNA regulation in AD brain, and observed differential splicing of 150 transcripts, which in some cases correlated with differential nELAVL binding. Unexpectedly, the most significant change of nELAVL binding was evident on non-coding Y RNAs. nELAVL/Y RNA complexes were specifically remodeled in AD and after acute UV stress in neuroblastoma cells. We propose that the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association during stress may lead to nELAVL sequestration, redistribution of nELAVL target binding, and altered neuronal RNA splicing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a gene is active, its DNA is copied into a molecule of RNA. This molecule then undergoes a process called splicing which removes certain segments, and the resulting ‘messenger RNA’ molecule is then translated into protein. Many messenger RNAs go through alternative splicing, whereby different segments can be included or excluded from the final molecule. This allows more than one type of protein to be produced from a single gene.</p><p>Specialized RNA binding proteins associate with messenger RNAs and regulate not only their splicing, but also their abundance and location within the cell. These activities are crucially important in the brain where forming memories and learning new skills requires thousands of proteins to be made rapidly. Many members of a family of RNA binding proteins called ELAV-like proteins are unique to neurons. These proteins have also been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, but it was not known which messenger RNAs were the targets of these proteins in the human brain.</p><p>Scheckel, Drapeau et al. have now addressed this question and used a method termed 'CLIP' to identify thousands of messenger RNAs that directly bind to neuronal ELAV-like proteins in the human brain. Many of these messenger RNAs coded for proteins that are important for the health of neurons, and neuronal ELAV-like proteins were shown to regulate both the alternative splicing and the abundance of these messenger RNAs.</p><p>The regulation of RNA molecules in post-mortem brain samples of people with or without Alzheimer’s disease was then compared. Scheckel, Drapeau et al. unexpectedly observed that, in the Alzheimer’s disease patients, the neuronal ELAV-like proteins were very often associated with a class of RNA molecules known as Y RNAs. These RNA molecules do not code for proteins, and are therefore classified as non-coding RNA. Moreover, massive shifts in the binding of ELAV-like proteins onto Y RNAs were observed in neurons grown in the laboratory that had been briefly stressed by exposure to ultraviolet radiation.</p><p>Scheckel, Drapeau et al. suggest that the strong tendency of neuronal ELAV-like proteins to bind to Y RNAs in conditions of short- or long-term stress, including Alzheimer’s disease, might prevent these proteins from associating with their normal messenger RNA targets. This was supported by finding that some messenger RNAs targeted by neuronal ELAV-like proteins showed altered regulation after stress. Such changes to the normal regulation of these messenger RNAs could have a large impact on the proteins that are produced from them.</p><p>Together, these findings link Y RNAs to both neuronal stress and Alzheimer’s disease, and suggest a new way that a cell can alter which messenger RNAs are expressed in response to changes in its environment. The next step is to explore what causes the shift in neuronal ELAV-like protein binding from messenger RNAs to Y RNAs and how it might contribute to disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>nELAVL</kwd><kwd>mRNA stability</kwd><kwd>Y RNA</kwd><kwd>noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>neuronal RNA binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>IMR-32 cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheckel</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SNF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early and Advanced Postdoc Mobility Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scheckel</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Seaver Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADRC AG005138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haroutunian</surname><given-names>Vahram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG02219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haroutunian</surname><given-names>Vahram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHSN27120130031C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haroutunian</surname><given-names>Vahram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma'ayan</surname><given-names>Avi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA189201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma'ayan</surname><given-names>Avi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HL127624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma'ayan</surname><given-names>Avi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>G Harold and Leila Y.

More than 800 RBPs have been described in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Castello et al., 2012</xref>). The unique structure and function of neurons, and the need to rapidly adapt RNA regulation in the brain both within and at sites distant from the nucleus, are consistent with specialized roles for RBPs in the brain. Indeed, mammalian neurons have developed their own system of RNA regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Darnell, 2013</xref>), and RBP:mRNA interactions are thought to regulate local protein translation at synapses, perhaps underlying learning and long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McKee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Numerous RBPs have been linked to human neurological disorders (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Richter and Klann (2009)</xref>). For example, <italic>FUS, TDP-43</italic> and <italic>ATXN2</italic> mutations have been found in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elden et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vance et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sreedharan et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>TDP-43</italic> has additionally been associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baloh, 2011</xref>), <italic>STEX</italic> has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chen et al., 2004</xref>), and spinal muscular atrophy can be caused by mutations in <italic>SMN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Clermont et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The neuronal ELAV-like (ELAVL) and NOVA RBPs are targeted by the immune system in paraneoplastic neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buckanovich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Szabo et al., 1991</xref>). Mammalian ELAVL proteins include the ubiquitously expressed paralog ELAVL1 (also termed HUA or HUR) and the three neuron-specific paralogs, ELAVL2, 3 and 4 (also termed HUB, C, and D, and collectively referred to as nELAVL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>). nELAVL proteins are expressed exclusively in neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Okano and Darnell, 1997</xref>), and they are important for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akamatsu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kasashima et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mobarak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aranda-Abreu et al., 1999</xref>). Redundancy between the three nELAVL isoforms complicates in vivo studies of their individual functions. Nevertheless, even haploinsuffiency of <italic>Elavl3</italic> is sufficient to trigger cortical hypersynchronization, and <italic>Elavl3</italic> and <italic>Elavl4</italic> null mice display defects in motor function and neuronal maturation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>ELAVL proteins have been shown to regulate several aspects of RNA metabolism. In vitro and in tissue culture cells, nELAVL proteins have been implicated in the regulation of stabilization and/or translation of specific mRNAs, as well as in the regulation of splicing and polyadenylation of select transcripts [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pascale et al.

A more comprehensive approach was taken by immunoprecipitating an overexpressed isoform of ELAVL4 in mice, although such RNA immunoprecipitation experiments cannot distinguish between direct and indirect targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolognani et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, direct binding of nELAVL to target RNAs in mouse brain was demonstrated by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>); these data, coupled with transcriptome profiling of <italic>Elavl3/4</italic> KO mice, demonstrated that nELAVL directly regulates neuronal mRNA abundance and alternative splicing by binding to U-rich elements with interspersed purine residues in 3’UTRs and introns in mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While genome-wide approaches have been applied to studying nELAVL proteins in mice, the targets of nELAVL in the human brain remain largely unknown. This is of particular importance, as nELAVL proteins have been implicated in neurological disorders such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amadio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kang et al., 2014</xref>) and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">DeStefano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Noureddine et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, to advance our understanding of the function of nELAVL in humans and its link to human disease, we set out to investigate nELAVL:RNA interactions in the human brain.</p><p>To globally identify transcripts directly bound by nELAVL in human neurons, we generated a genome wide RNA binding map of nELAVL in human brain using CLIP. CLIP allows the identification of functional RNA-protein interactions in vivo by using UV-irradiation of intact tissues to covalently crosslink and then purify RNA-protein complexes present in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ule et al., 2003</xref>). This method has been adopted for a variety of RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Darnell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we systemically identified tens of thousands of reproducible nELAVL binding sites in human brain and showed that nELAVL binds transcripts that are important for neurological function and that have been linked to neurological diseases such as AD. We validated the functional consequences of nELAVL binding in mice and cultured human neuroblastoma cells and showed that the loss of nELAVL affected mRNA abundance and alternative splicing of hundreds of transcripts. We further investigated RNA regulation in AD brains, and found that numerous transcripts were differentially spliced in AD, which correlated with differential nELAVL binding in some cases. Remarkably, we observed the most significant increase in nELAVL binding in AD on a class of non-coding RNAs, Y RNAs. We recapitulated these findings in human neuroblastoma cells, showing that nELAVL binding is linked to Y ribonucleoprotein (RNP) remodeling acutely during UV-induced stress, and chronically in AD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of nELAVL targets in human brain</title><p>To gain insight into nELAVL-mediated RNA regulation in human brain we performed CLIP on postmortem brain samples of eight human subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

We searched for and identified nELAVL RNA binding sites (peaks) that were significant (p&lt;0.01) and that were present in at least five out of 8 individuals (n = 75,592). nELAVL binding at these sites correlated between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and these peaks were further investigated. We determined the nELAVL binding motif by analyzing the top 500 nELAVL peaks (+/- 25nt) using MEME ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</xref>) and HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). This revealed that nELAVL binds polyU RNA stretches in human brain, particularly when interrupted by a G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is in excellent agreement with the nELAVL binding motif identified in mouse brain using CLIP and in vitro binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>). Because nELAVL has been shown to regulate alternative splicing and mRNA abundance in mouse brain by binding to introns and 3’UTRs, respectively, we analyzed the genomic distribution of the peaks defined here. As previously reported for mouse nElavl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>), nELAVL binding sites are found in 3’UTRs and introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with far higher per-nucleotide density in 3’UTR regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistently we observed that nELAVL peaks in 3’UTRs were higher than intronic peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that nELAVL could regulate splicing and mRNA abundance in the human brain.</p><p>To relate nELAVL binding to mRNA abundance, we performed RNAseq on the same brain samples used for CLIP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A/B</xref>). 74,423 nELAVL peaks mapped to 8681 expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), referred to as nELAVL targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>) hereafter, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. We observed that nELAVL binding correlated with mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This was not unexpected, as nELAVL 3’ UTR binding has previously been shown to increase mRNA abundance, due to its role in mRNA stabilization. The correlation between nELAVL binding and mRNA abundance might therefore not only reflect the dependence of nELAVL binding on mRNA abundance, but also a role of nELAVL in mRNA stabilization. Consistently, we observed that intronic nELAVL binding correlated less with mRNA abundance than 3’UTR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To identify genes most likely to be impacted by nELAVL, we defined the top 1000 nELAVL targets (colored in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). Top targets were identified based on normalized nELAVL binding (binding sites were normalized for mRNA abundance and summarized per gene). Thirty-seven percent of nELAVL peaks (n = 27,581) mapped to these top targets. We constructed a subnetwork that connects top nELAVL target gene products based on a literature-based network of protein-protein interactions (PPI) created from multiple online databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Six clusters were identified within the resulting network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and gene set enrichment analyses were performed for top nELAVL targets found in the different clusters with Enrichr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Each cluster was examined for enrichment of Biological Processes (BP), Molecular Functions (MF), Cellular Components, and Mammalian Phenotypes (MP) terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). Enriched terms included RNA processing and transcription regulation, signal transduction, synaptic transmission, synaptic proteins, and abnormal neuron morphology and physiology. Three of the six clusters were particularly important for neuronal function. Cluster 1 is especially enriched in members of the TGFbeta/SMAD signaling pathways and the FOX protein family. Cluster 2 contains many actors of the IGF-I axis, which is important for neuronal development including neurogenesis, myelination, synaptogenesis, dendritic branching and neuroprotection after neuronal damage. Finally, cluster 3 is almost exclusively formed of synaptic proteins including many postsynaptic scaffolding proteins, members of the neuroligin/neurexin families and glutamatergic receptors or voltage-gated channels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that nELAVL associates with transcripts encoding proteins involved in key aspects of neuronal physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>nELAVL-mediated regulation is conserved</title><p>To investigate if nELAVL-mediated RNA regulation is conserved, we compared our dataset with previously published nELAVL targets in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolognani et al., 2010</xref>).

The vast majority of these overlapping binding sites were in 3’UTRs (88%). These results indicate that many nELAVL targets are shared between mouse and human and that nELAVL binding at the transcript level is conserved, whereas individual binding sites have diverged drastically, especially within introns.

Since nELAVL binding to 3’UTRs can mediate mRNA stabilization, we investigated the change in mRNA abundance of 3’UTR targets upon <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi, specifically examining 3’UTR targets that did not display any intronic binding. These transcripts were less abundant in <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel). In contrast, the mRNA abundance of intron targets (intron binding but no 3’UTR binding) slightly increased upon <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). This suggests that specifically nELAVL binding to 3’UTRs increases mRNA abundance. We further observed that nELAVL depletion affected top nELAVL 3’UTR targets as well as nELAVL 3’UTR targets in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Out of 784 genes that changed significantly upon <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi, 743 genes were expressed in human brain, 327 of which decreased while 416 increased. We investigated which of these transcripts were direct targets of nELAVL based on nELAVL 3’UTR binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2D</xref>). Significantly changing transcripts that are top nELAVL 3’UTR targets are boxed in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.

In contrast, only 7% of upregulated transcripts were among top 3’UTR targets (p = 0.76; hypergeometric test), further supporting a role of nELAVL 3’UTR binding in positively regulating mRNA abundance. Several 3’UTR targets showed an mRNA abundance change in both mouse and IMR-32 datasets (n = 8), and in all but one case this change correlated positively between the datasets, providing support for the accuracy of target validation applied here. Because the abundance of multiple disease associated genes, including <italic>APPBP2, ATXN3</italic>, and <italic>SHANK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), is regulated by nELAVL, we propose that nELAVL mediated regulation of mRNA abundance plays an important role in the human brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>nELAVL regulates splicing of human brain targets</title><p>To validate a role of nELAVL in the splicing regulation of human brain targets, we analyzed the inclusion rate of cassette exons in mock and <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi treated IMR-32 cells. We compared the change in exon inclusion of 7903 expressed cassette exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2E</xref>) and observed that 473 cassette exons were differentially spliced upon nELAVL depletion (FDR&lt;0.05 and ΔI &gt; 0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2F</xref>).

For example, downstream binding in <italic>BIN1</italic> and <italic>PICALM</italic> was associated with lower exon inclusion upon nELAVL depletion, and binding in <italic>APP</italic> was associated with higher inclusion of both upstream and downstream exons upon nELAVL depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B/C</xref>).

ELAVL binding can be modulated in response to stress in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>), and ELAVL proteins, which shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to environmental cues, preferentially accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gallouzi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan and Steitz, 1998b</xref>).

The induction of a UV stress response was confirmed by measuring <italic>CDKN1A</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We did not observe a change in nucleocytoplasmic localization of the investigated RNAs or proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B/C</xref>), suggesting that the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association upon UV exposure does not result from a difference in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of nELAVL or Y RNAs. These results are consistent with previous observations that neuronal ELAVL proteins show a higher cytoplasmic localization than the ubiquitous paralog ELAVL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kasashima et al., 1999</xref>), and that stress-induced nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling might be limited to ELAVL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burry and Smith, 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, these results do not rule out the possibility that there may be changes of nELAVL proteins within the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments themselves with respect to Y RNA binding and localization.</p><p>We next sought to measure the proportion of nELAVL bound to Y RNAs in stressed and non-stressed conditions. Because Y RNAs are relatively short and have a high degree of similarity, our mapping strategy (reporting only unambiguous mapping events) discarded numerous reads that were assigned to multiple Y RNAs. We therefore re-mapped CLIP tags, allowing multiple alignments, but reporting only the best match, permitting a more accurate estimate of overall Y RNA binding. The fraction of the short CLIP reads mapping to Y RNAs was considerably higher using this strategy, revealing that up to 6% of nELAVL CLIP tags map to Y RNAs in AD and UV stressed cells, compared to less than 0.5% in control brain and ~1% in non-stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). The significant increase in nELAVL/Y RNA association and our observation that up to 6% of nELAVL was bound to Y RNAs might in fact lead to a sequestration of nELAVL from its targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>nELAVL/Y RNA association correlates with loss of nELAVL-mediated splicing</title><p>To investigate if the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association was linked to decreased intronic and 3’UTR nELAVL binding, we grouped AD subjects based on their Y RNA association and compared the two different AD groups to control subjects.

Because nELAVL binding in UV-stressed cells also predominantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and most of the decreased binding sites were in introns (85%, assessed by annotation of peak locations), we speculate that nELAVL/Y RNA association leads to a sequestration of nELAVL specifically from its intron targets, which might induce similar splicing changes as <italic>nELAVL</italic> depletion by RNAi. Of note is our observation that nELAVL binding decreased at only a subset of intronic binding sites.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10421.026</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>nELAVL/Y RNA correlates with loss of nELAVL-mediated splicing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Samples with high nELAVL/Y RNA association show decreased nELAVL binding on mRNA targets.

Comparing UV-induced splicing changes between mock and <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi treated cells, we identified 260 cassette exons that showed a differential inclusion rate upon UV stress only in the presence of nELAVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We intersected these splicing changes with <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi induced splicing changes (n = 553), and found a significant overlap between the two lists (n = 68; p = 9.7e<sup>-28</sup>; hypergeometric test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2E</xref>). Importantly, splicing of the vast majority of exons (66 out of 68) changed in the same direction, indicating that changes in nELAVL binding due to UV stress partially recapitulate <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi depletion. This finding is consistent with a model of UV-induced nELAVL sequestration from a subset of targets.</p><p>Due to the wide difference between AD subjects and UV stressed IMR-32 cells, the targets affected by nELAVL sequestration in the two systems are likely to be markedly divergent. We nevertheless explored if any of the 66 affected exons in IMR-32 cells were adjacent (+/- 2.5 kb) to intronic nELAVL binding sites in human brain, and observed that 7 alternatively spliced exons were indeed next to intronic nELAVL binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>/ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, nELAVL binding at all of these sites decreased in AD subjects with Y RNA association but not in AD subjects without Y RNA association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), although nELAVL peak binding changed significantly at only one binding site (boxed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, FDR = 0.003). We also investigated if decreased nELAVL peak binding was associated with corresponding splicing changes in AD subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The inclusion rate of only one of the 7 exons changed significantly in AD patients with high nELAVL/Y RNA association (FDR = 0.04), and the direction of the splicing change was indeed the same as the splicing changes observed upon UV or <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi treatment. This is consistent with our observation that only few splicing changes are shared between AD and UV treatment, which likely reflects the much more complex situation in human brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Y RNA overexpression is linked to nELAVL sequestration from mRNA targets</title><p>To directly test the model of Y RNA mediated nELAVL sequestration, we overexpressed canonical Y3wt (wild type) and Y3mut (with a mutated nELAVL binding site) using lentiviral infections of IMR-32 cells.

The mRNA abundance changes upon Y3wt and Y3mut infection compared to non-infected controls were very similar, indicating that most mRNA abundance changes are due to lentiviral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A;</xref> 70% of Y3wt changes overlapped with Y3mut changes; p = 1.3e<sup>-175</sup>; hypergeometric test). To investigate virus-independent changes, we focused on the changes between Y3wt and Y3mut infection. nELAVL 3’UTR targets were not enriched among mRNAs that changed between Y3mut compared to Y3wt infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which is in agreement with our hypothesis that nELAVL sequestration predominantly affects intronic nELAVL binding sites and thus nELAVL mediated splicing.</p><p>In contrast to the mRNA abundance changes, only few splicing changes overlapped between Y3wt and Y3mut infection when compared to non-infected cells (17% of Y3wt induced changes overlapped with Y3mut induced changes). Most of the observed splicing changes are therefore likely to be specific to Y RNA overexpression. Importantly, we observed an enrichment of nELAVL bound exons and of <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi dependent exons among the exons that changed upon Y3wt but not Y3mut overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C/D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">5</xref>). The relatively small enrichment is consistent with the modest increase in total Y3-like Y RNAs. These results suggest that Y RNA overexpression results in nELAVL sequestration from some of its intronic targets and consequent splicing changes, and partially recapitulates the stress induced nELAVL sequestration due to increased nELAVL/Y RNA association seen in AD patients and UV treated IMR-32 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Discussion</title><p>nELAVL proteins are abundant neuron-specific RNA binding proteins which have been suggested to regulate various neurological processes and have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including AD and PD. Yet the RNA targets of nELAVL in human brain were completely unknown. Here, we generated a comprehensive genome-wide RNA binding map of nELAVL in human brain, identifying 75,592 significant binding events within 8681 transcripts. We observed a significant overlap between these binding sites and disease-associated 3’UTR SNPs, and the potential disruption of nELAVL-mediated RNA regulation at these sites might contribute to disease manifestation. Most deleterious variants to date have been identified by exome sequencing while as many as 50% of disease-causing mutations are thought to affect splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ward and Cooper, 2009</xref>). With whole genome sequencing being increasingly available, non-coding variants are also increasingly detected, some of which may be linked to disease. As the majority of nELAVL binding occurs in introns and 3’UTRs, we expect that many binding sites will overlap with prospective disease-associated non-coding variants. The overlap between deleterious variants and nELAVL binding sites, and the observation that nELAVL binding at individual sites diverged between mice and human, underscores the importance of this study and illustrates the caveat of relying solely on mouse models when studying human disease. Considering the widespread nature of nELAVL binding in human brain and that RNA dysregulation has been linked to numerous neurological disorders, we believe that this binding map will be a valuable resource for the scientific community.</p><p>To analyze the functional consequences of nELAVL binding, we used two different loss-of-function models: <italic>Elavl3/4</italic> KO mice and nELAVL RNAi depletion in neuroblastoma cells. Due to the incomplete RNAi depletion of nELAVL in neuroblastoma cells, and potential differences in mRNA abundance and therefore nELAVL binding between the different samples, it is likely that we validated only a fraction of nELAVL-regulated transcripts. Despite these technical limitations we demonstrated that nELAVL impacts mRNA abundance and/or splicing of hundreds of targets. Among the nELAVL regulated transcripts were many transcripts implicated in human disease, including AD, which led us to investigate RNA regulation in AD subjects. Due to the relatively small sample size and the heterogeneity between these samples, likely due to both differences between individuals and sample preservation during postmortem collection, we did not detect many reproducible changes in mRNA abundance or nELAVL binding between AD and non-AD subjects. However, we found that 150 transcripts were differentially spliced in AD subjects, which in some cases coincided with differential nELAVL binding. Unexpectedly, the most significant binding change in AD was a dramatic increase in nELAVL binding to a class of non-coding RNAs, termed Y RNAs. This change was evident on a specific subset of Y RNAs harboring the nELAVL binding site. nELAVL/Y RNA binding also increased during UV stress in human neuroblastoma cells, while the abundance of Y RNAs remained constant in AD subjects and upon UV exposure. The increased nELAVL/Y RNA association correlated with decreased nELAVL binding at a subset of intronic binding sites, and was associated with similar splicing changes as induced by nELAVL depletion, suggesting that nELAVL/Y RNP remodeling during acute and chronic stress sequesters nELAVL from its mRNA targets. We provided further evidence for a Y RNA dependent nELAVL sequestration by overexpressing Y3 RNAs harboring either a wild type or mutated nELAVL binding site. Exons that were differentially spliced upon Y RNA overexpression were enriched for nELAVL bound exons, indicating nELAVL sequestration, which was dependent on an intact nELAVL binding site in the Y RNA.</p><p>nELAVL 3’UTR binding has been implicated in increasing mRNA abundance in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>). We described numerous nELAVL 3’UTR targets in brain, and were able to validate many of these targets, including disease-associated transcripts, indicating that nELAVL 3’UTR binding is important for the regulation of mRNA abundance in human brain. While ELAVL binding is frequently reported to result in an increase in mRNA abundance, we found several cases where nELAVL binding seemed to have an opposing effect. ELAVL proteins can compete or collaborate with miRNAs as well as RBPs like AUF1, CUGBP1 and TIA1 to regulate its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kawai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Young et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). The ultimate outcome of nELAVL 3’UTR binding might therefore vary between individual transcripts.</p><p>nELAVL has also been shown to regulate splicing in mouse brain by binding to intronic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ince-Dunn et al., 2012</xref>). We observed many instances of intronic nELAVL binding events adjacent to alternative exons in brain, and confirmed that nELAVL regulates many of these exons in mice and neuroblastoma cells. In contrast to the position-dependent splicing observed for other RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>), we observed that upstream nELAVL binding was associated with both exon skipping and inclusion. While nELAVL binding was observed within 25-50 nucleotides upstream of skipped exons, coinciding with the branch point sequence, nELAVL binding peaked within the proximal 25 nucleotides upstream of included exons, overlapping the polypyrimidine tract. Binding of auxiliary splicing factors, including nELAVL, to the branch point sequence usually interferes with spliceosome assembly and thus leads to exon skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). Polypyrimidine tract binding however can lead to both exon inclusion and skipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), presumably depending on the recruitment of splicing enhancers or silencers. Our data indicates that upstream nELAVL binding can both interfere with the assembly of the spliceosome as well as promote splicing, most likely by recruiting splicing enhancers.</p><p>Splicing defects have been associated with many neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2006</xref>), and among the nELAVL-regulated transcripts we describe here are numerous transcripts related to disease, including AD. For example, intronic nELAVL binding of the gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein, APP, was associated with skipping of exons 7 and 8. Both exons have previously been shown to be alternatively spliced and encode for the Kunitz protease inhibitory (KPI) motif, a domain that has been linked to APP processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben Khalifa et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, KPI domain containing isoforms of APP have been shown to be increased in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that APP splicing might contribute to AD pathogenesis, and that nELAVL binding in human brain might be important to regulate the inclusion of the KPI domain. nELAVL regulates the splicing of two more AD-related transcripts, PICALM and BIN1, by promoting the inclusion of alternative exons 13 and 6a, respectively. Both proteins have been implicated in APP trafficking and both exons lie within domains mediating protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Treusch et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, inclusion of the alternative exon 13 in PICALM has been linked to an AD-associated SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parikh et al., 2014</xref>), and we observed in this study that exon 6a of BIN1 shows a higher inclusion rate in controls compared to AD subjects. Since nELAVL binding promotes the inclusion of this exon, and control subjects show higher nELAVL binding, we propose that the altered splicing of BIN1 in AD subjects might be due to differential nELAVL binding. In fact, several nELAVL-regulated exons have been shown to be differentially spliced in AD subjects, further strengthening the link between nELAVL dysregulation and AD.</p><p>While Y RNAs have not been linked to AD before, they have been implicated in various types of stress responses. The RNA binding protein RO60 usually associates with Y RNAs and is required for their stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Labbé et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wolin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xue et al., 2003</xref>). Besides RO60, Y RNPs contain several other RBPs such as ZBP1, MOV10, and Y-box proteins, and have been found to be remodeled upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sim et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggests that nELAVL becomes increasingly associated with specific Y RNAs during both UV-induced stress and AD. ELAVL proteins can shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in response to environmental cues and preferentially accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules upon cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fan and Steitz, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gallouzi et al., 2000</xref>), and ELAVL binding to the CAT-1 transcript is modulated in response to stress in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, while we found that nELAVL specifically associates with Y RNAs during AD and acute UV stress, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of nELAVL, RO60, and Y RNAs was not affected by UV stress. Because Y RNA levels remained constant, we propose that Y RNP complexes are specifically remodeled during AD and acute stress, which is not likely due to a change in nucleocytoplasmic protein/RNA distribution. These results are consistent with previous observations that stress induced shuttling might be limited to ELAVL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burry and Smith, 2006</xref>). Our observation of Y RNP remodeling in two very different systems of neuronal stress suggests that differential nELAVL/Y RNA association may be a widespread phenomenon and a focus of future studies.</p><p>In addition to the four canonical human Y RNAs, hY1/3/4/5, hundreds of additional Y RNA genes are distributed throughout the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Perreault et al., 2005</xref>). The apparent lack of promoters upstream led to a premature designation of these Y RNAs as pseudogenes. Surprisingly, we found that hundreds of these Y RNA copies are expressed in human brain and neuroblastoma cells, although it remains unclear if these Y RNAs can still associate with RO60, because the RO60 binding site in many Y RNA copies is mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Perreault et al., 2005</xref>). We observed that numerous Y RNA copies were more strongly associated with nELAVL in AD brain and acutely stressed cells, yet nELAVL binding did not affect their levels, indicating a function for this interaction other than Y RNA stabilization. While the outcome of nELAVL/Y RNA remains to be elucidated, our work revealed an aspect of nELAVL/Y RNA association related to stoichiometry. Hundreds of Y RNAs are bound by nELAVL in AD and UV-stress, which corresponds to up to 5% of all nELAVL CLIP tags. This shift of nELAVL binding may distort the normal stoichiometry of nELAVL interactions with its mRNA targets. Indeed, non-coding RNAs have previously been shown to affect RBP-RNA stoichiometry and therefore the biological function of other RNAs or RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cazalla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). Our data indicate that the binding of nELAVL to Y RNAs during stress may lead to a redistribution of nELAVL binding and/or competition of nELAVL from other RNAs. Consistently, we found that high nELAVL/Y RNA association was associated with a general decrease in nELAVL binding at a subset of binding sites, especially within introns, and consequential splicing changes were reminiscent of splicing changes provoked by nELAVL depletion. Consistently, splicing changes induced by Y RNA overexpression showed an enrichment of nELAVL binding that was dependent on the presence of the ELAVL binding motif in Y RNAs. Hence we propose that the increased association of nELAVL and Y RNAs during stress causes sequestration of nELAVL from its mRNA targets.</p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that nELAVL becomes strongly associated with Y RNAs in some AD subjects as well as in cells subjected to UV stress, and this is linked to a sequestration of nELAVL from some of its intronic targets, partially recapitulating splicing changes induced by nELAVL depletion. Our results are consistent with a hypothesis that a relatively subtle and perhaps long-term effect of Y RNA binding on normal nELAVL stoichiometry may underlie subtle and long-term changes in nELAVL biology. Perhaps analogously, the sequestration of the RBP, TDP-43, has previously been linked to neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). While the underlying mechanisms of TDP-43 and nELAVL sequestration are distinct, relatively subtle and long-term rearrangement of RNA:protein stoichiometry and interactions might be a recurrent theme of neurodegeneration.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined a robust and reproducible map of nELAVL binding sites on both mRNA and Y RNA targets in human brain. This database has both common and human-specific features that confirm and enhance previous work in mice and underscore its value as a resource for scientific inquiry. We have linked the data to genome-wide measurements of both mRNA levels and splicing suggesting specific functions for these important interactions. Moreover, we have uncovered a stress-modulated interaction of nELAVL proteins with non-coding Y RNAs. Y RNPs are remodeled during both UV-induced and chronic AD-related stress, which may be causally related to the pathophysiology of stress by causing a redistribution of nELAVL RNA target binding. Data implicating nELAVL proteins in several neurologic diseases, as well as the overlap of nELAVL binding sites we describe here with SNPs linked to the same and additional human diseases underscore the importance of this resource for the ongoing study of the molecular basis of human neurologic disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Brain samples</title><p>Frozen brain tissue was obtained from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank.

Data was visualized with UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">http://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>). To reduce mis-alignments due to sequencing errors, reads were initially filtered based on quality score (≥20 in the degenerate linker region; average of ≥20 in the remaining read). Exact sequences were collapsed to remove PCR duplicates. The degenerate barcode (and index if applicable) were removed and the 3’ linker was trimmed. Using FASTA files as input, reads were subsequently mapped to the hg18 build of the human genome by novoalign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.novocraft.com">www.novocraft.com</ext-link>), requiring unambiguous mapping and a maximum of two mismatches. To identify unique CLIP tags, we applied stringent filtering, and collapsed reads with the same starting genomic positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>), and only unique tags (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) were used for subsequent analyses.

The libraries from subjects 6–8 and 15–17, as well Y RNA overexpression samples, were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the New York Genome Center, generating 125-bp paired end reads.

Only expressed genes and robustly bound peaks were analyzed to reduce multiple testing. Expressed genes were defined as genes that had more than one count per million (cpm) in at least 5 control brain samples (out of 8), in 6 AD brain samples (out of 9), or in 4 IMR-32 samples (out of 12 RNAi/UV samples or 9 Y RNA infection samples, respectively). Robustly bound peaks were defined as peaks that had more than one cpm in at least 5 control or AD brain samples (out of 8 and 9, respectively), or in 2 control or 4 UV IMR-32 samples (out of 3 and 6, respectively). We controlled for batch effects of brain samples (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) and estimated the false discovery rate (FDR) with an optimized FDR approach (q-value methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>]) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. PeakHeight (PH, CLIP tags within peaks) was normalized for library size, and, to account for differences in gene expression level, normalized PH was determined by dividing PH by rpkm of the corresponding gene. nELAVL binding was defined as the summary of PH per gene, whereas normalized nELAVL binding was defined as the summary of normalized PH per gene. We similarly defined 3’UTR and intronic binding by summarizing only 3’UTR or intronic peaks, respectively. Top targets were defined as the top 1000 genes according to normalized nELAVL binding. mRNA abundance was defined as cpm RNAseq tags per gene. We did not normalize nELAVL binding nor mRNA abundance for transcript length as we performed differential analysis of the datasets. A pseudocount of 1 was added before log2 transformation. Cross-correlation plots show log2 raw counts of PH or RNAseq reads per gene. Splicing changes were determined using the observed inclusion and exclusion junction read counts and by fitting a generalized linear model with a logit link function. For each exon, GLM likelihood ratio test was conducted to test if there was a significant difference in the fraction of exon inclusion (delta Inclusion, ΔI) between conditions, and controlling for batch variables of brain samples. ΔI (equivalent to delta PSI) was calculated by subtracting fraction exon inclusion of Sample 2 from fraction exon inclusion of Sample 1. FDR was calculated as described before using the q-value method. High confidence alternative splicing events were identified by requiring a stringent criteria of FDR&lt;0.05 and ΔI≥0.1. P-values to assess the statistical significance of the overlap between gene lists were calculated with a hypergeometric test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5</xref>). A paired Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate differences in Y RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C/7B</xref>), and a t-test was used to evaluate changes in mRNA/Y RNA/protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B/9A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>).

To discriminate between individual Y RNA copies we used CLIP reads, aligned with novoalign. While this mapping strategy allowed us to discrimate between individual Y RNA copies with high confidence, CLIP reads that mapped to multiple Y RNAs were discarded. Exclusively for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>, CLIP tags were therefore additionally aligned with Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>), allowing multiple alignments and reporting one. This allowed us to estimate the overall amount of CLIP tags on all Y RNAs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Y RNA abundance in brain, and UV- and RNAi-treated IMR-32 cells was defined as RNAseq tags on Y RNAs, using unambiguously mapped tags aligned with TopHat. Similar to above, reads that mapped to multiple Y RNAs were discarded using this strategy. To estimate overall Y RNA overexpression upon lentiviral infection, we mapped RNAseq reads of infected samples with Bowtie2, allowing multiple alignments and reporting the best matched alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Y RNA overexpression was determined with two additional strategies. We performed qPCR with primers that recognized infected Y RNAs (Y3wt and Y3mut) but also an unknown number of endogenous Y RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Additionally, we directly searched for 40- and 68-nt sequences of Y3wt and Y3mut sequences in the Illumina sequenced library reads (both 40- and 68-nt sequences spanned the mutated residues). The 68-nt sequence was only present in the infected Y RNAs and the canonical hY3 RNA, and searching for this sequencing length showed that both Y3wt as well as Y3mut were overexpressed. To more accurately estimate the extent of overexpression, we additionally searched for a 40-nt Y RNA sequence. The Y3wt sequence is present in a large number of endogenous Y RNAs, whereas the Y3mut sequence only detects infected Y3mut. By comparing Y3wt and Y3mut reads in Y3mut infected samples, we observed that infected Y RNA reads (Y3mut reads) correspond to 10% of total Y3 RNA reads (Y3wt reads).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Motif analysis</title><p>The MEME-ChIP Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Machanick and Bailey, 2011</xref>) and HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) were used for motif discovery.

Shown are Entrez Gene ID and Symbol, rpkm and log2 cpm, and the peak number, log2 nELAVL binding (CLIP tags within peaks were summarized per transcript), and log2 normalized nELAVL binding (CLIP tags within peaks were normalized for mRNA abundance and summarized per transcript) of peaks (if applicable) in human brain. Top targets are indicated in in the last column. (C) Overlap of top nELAVL targets and GWAS-associated AD genes. Displayed are 77 top nELAVL targets with AD-associated SNPs (p&lt; 0.001). Entrez Gene ID and Symbol, rpkm and log2 cpm, and the peak number, log2 nELAVL binding (CLIP tags within peaks were summarized per transcript), and log2 normalized nELAVL binding (CLIP tags within peaks were normalized for mRNA abundance and summarized per transcript) of peaks (if applicable) in human brain are shown. (D) nELAVL binding sites in control and AD subject brain. The table contains 113,671 nELAVL binding sites that are bound in control or AD brain and that present within expressed genes. Included are PeakName, hg18 and hg19 genomic coordinates (chromosome, start, end, strand), Entrez Gene ID and Symbol, genomic region, PH (PeakHeight), PH normalized for mRNA abundance, and BC (biological complexity) in control and AD brain, and log2 cpm (counts per million CLIP reads per peak), log2 FC (fold change), p and FDR values comparing PH between control and AD brain. (E) Splicing changes in AD Displayed are 170 alternative splicing (AS) events that change in AD. Shown are AS event information (Name, hg18 and hg19 genomic coordinates of the AS event and the alternative exon), Entrez Gene ID and Symbol, exon inclusion fraction in control and AD brain (PSI), the change in exon inclusion (ΔI), p and FDR values comparing PSI between control and AD brain. Among the differentially spliced exons were five nELAVL regulated exons (validated in IMR-32 cells), which were adjacent to 8 intronic peaks). For those exons, alternative exon inclusion in mock and <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi (PSI), the change in exon inclusion (ΔI), p and FDR values comparing PSI between mock and <italic>nELAVL</italic> RNAi treated cells, and information of adjacent peaks (Name, hg18 and hg19 genomic coordinates, biological complexity (BC), PH (PeakHeight), PH normalized for mRNA abundance, and the peak position relative to the alternative exon) is additionally included. (F) Y RNA expression and nELAVL binding in brain and IMR-32 cells. Table containing 864 Y RNAs. Shown are Y RNA information (Name, hg18 and hg19 Y RNA coordinates, the presence of 6mer or 5mer Hu binding motif, and type), and log2 average of YRNA sequencing (seq) and nELAVL binding (CLIP) in brain and IMR-32 cells, and the YRNA expression log2 fold change upon Y3wt and Y3mut infection. Y RNAs bound in AD and IMR-32 cells can be extracted by selecting BC_brain_CLIP≥2 and BC_IMR-32_CLIP ≥ 2, respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, and two reviewers, one of whom, Douglas Black, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper from the Darnell group examines the RNA binding sites of the nELAVL family in human brain. The authors perform CLIP analysis and RNAseq in the BA9 region of the prefrontal cortex. They identify a large set of RNA binding sites and presumed target transcripts. They define the nELAVL binding motif as similar to the previously defined motif for the mouse and show that there is strong overlap between the targets seen in mouse and human. They show that nELAVL knockdown in human neuroblastoma cells causes reduced expression of mRNAs that exhibit 3' UTR binding. Similarly, exons with adjacent nELAVL binding show altered splicing with knockdown. Interestingly, both positively and negatively regulated exons exhibit enriched binding upstream, and thus do not present the same correlation of binding position with positive or negative regulation as seen with some other splicing regulators. Earlier results had made a connection of nELAVL proteins and Alzheimer's disease, and the authors next analyzed splicing and nELAVL binding in AD brains, finding some exons and binding events that differ between AD and control brains. The most significant change was a greatly increased level of nELAVL binding to a subset of Y RNAs in the AD brains. Y RNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs in eukaryotic cells that affect RNA scavenging and quality control pathways. A subset of these RNAs contain an nELAVL binding site. Cellular stress is known to relocalize ELAV proteins to the cytoplasm, and they find that stressing tissue culture cells with low UV doses also increases nELAV/Y RNA binding as measured by CLIP. This is accompanied by changes in nELAV dependent splicing, presumably due to reduced nuclear protein.</p><p>This is a novel study of a topic with broad interest. The nELAV proteins have been widely studied. The extension of these analyses to the human system and to AD is significant, with the connection of nELAVL proteins to the Y RNAs being potentially very important. The authors present a large amount of work and the datasets generated will be a valuable resource for further studies. However, the analysis does not extend past identifying broad correlations between datasets, leaving the biological or mechanistic conclusions unclear. A number of unaddressed issues regarding the identified nELAV/Y RNA interaction make its significance hard to judge. The paper is also difficult to digest. It is hard to follow what was actually done in the various statistical comparisons, what the results mean, and the authors conclusions often seem vague. They often point to rather weak correlations as being &quot;consistent&quot; with a particular model. Sometimes they use abbreviations and acronyms that don't seem to have been defined (for example, is dI the same as delta PSI?). There are a number of places where the analytical methods used could be improved or at least better explained.</p><p>Major issue:</p><p>1) The most significant finding in the study is the binding of nELAVL to the Y RNAs, but this is not taken far enough to draw many conclusions. Is it the increased Y RNA binding that is causing the change in splicing or is it a consequence of increased cytoplasmic protein that is the result of cellular stress? How much Y RNA is there relative to nELAVL? What percent of the nELAVL is actually bound by the Y RNAs? Are the amounts sufficient to sequester most of the ELAVL and thus have an effect? Why do so many Y RNAs without ELAVL binding motifs also appear to be binding? Can the authors connect the splicing or expression changes observed in the UV treated IMR32 cells to those seen in AD? Without this, it is difficult to make the case that the cytoplasmic relocalization of the nELAVL proteins is relevant to AD. The reviewers all felt that the authors should work to make some of these mechanistic connections between the Y RNAs and AD and thus strengthen this most interesting finding.</p><p>Issues regarding the analytical methods:</p><p>1) The peak finding in the CLIP analysis needs to be better described. The authors refer to Licatalosi (2012), but that paper describes a relatively outmoded method of defining peaks above a gene specific background, as well as the use of the much better CIMS analysis from the Darnell and Zhang groups. It doesn't appear that CIMS analysis was used here, so what exactly was done?</p><p>2) Similarly, MEME-ChIP has been shown to not work well for RBP motif finding. Stating that the motif identified in human is in excellent agreement with that found in mouse is not very meaningful since both studies used the same MEME-ChIP analysis. The authors should investigate the use of newer tools such as Graphprot (Maticzka et al. Genome Biology 2014) or Zagros (Bahrami-Samani et al., NAR, 2015) for motif discovery.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, are the peak numbers in different regions normalized for the lengths of the different types of sequences?</p><p>4) There are also normalization questions regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1E</xref> and other plots. These plots show correlation between CLIP peaks and tags with mRNA abundance as measured by sequence reads per gene. This is problematic on several levels. First, both CLIP and RNAseq reads will be strongly affected by gene length. A better comparison is to use CLIP clusters per unit length of gene vs RPKM from RNAseq, which will normalize both values by gene length. Second even with length normalization, CLIP clusters will automatically vary strongly with gene expression level. A true comparison would need to look at the distributions of sequence density for genes in the CLIP and RNAseq datasets.</p><p>5) The authors use the human genome release hg18 for their alignments, although the conclusions do not likely depend on the genome release. Most people in the field are using the now 6-year-old hg19 and it would make it much easier for others to use these results if the authors were to update their pipelines to hg19.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10421.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>This paper from the Darnell group examines the RNA binding sites of the nELAVL family in human brain.

We hope these changes will make the manuscript easier to follow.</p><p><italic>Major issue:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The most significant finding in the study is the binding of nELAVL to the Y RNAs, but this is not taken far enough to draw many conclusions. Is it the increased Y RNA binding that is causing the change in splicing or is it a consequence of increased cytoplasmic protein that is the result of cellular stress?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers suggest two possibilities to account for the change in splicing upon stress. We addressed the possibility that a decrease in nuclear nELAVL might lead to the splicing changes in AD and upon UV stress. To address this point, we have added cell fractionation experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref> shows that the cytoplasmic fraction of nELAVL did not increase upon UV stress in IMR32 cells (using induction of CDKN1A as a positive control for the induction of UV stress). Similarly, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of YRNAs did not change under the UV stress conditions we used (same Figure). This suggests that changes observed upon UV stress in IMR32 cells are not due to changes in the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of nELAVL. This does not address whether there may be changes of nELAVL accessibility within either of these compartments. We note that Burry and Smith (2006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) did see relocalization of ELAVL1 (HuR) under conditions of stress, but did not see relocalization of ELAVL4 (HuD). Hence the biology of the different nELAVL isoforms may depend on many variables, including cell type and stress conditions. We discuss these points in the manuscript in the subsection “Y RNPs are remodeled during UV stress”.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ second possibility, we have included new data to examine the role of Y RNA induced splicing changes (see below).</p><p><italic>How much Y RNA is there relative to nELAVL? What percent of the nELAVL is actually bound by the Y RNAs? Are the amounts sufficient to sequester most of the ELAVL and thus have an effect?</italic> </p><p>To address this point, we have estimated how much of the total amount of nELAVL is bound by Y RNAs under control versus stress conditions. Each Y RNA family (Y1/Y3/Y4/Y5) consists of multiple variants expressed from different genomic loci. These copies are relatively short and very similar, yet too different to be detected by one Taqman probe or one qPCR primer set. This makes absolute quantification of Y RNA levels difficult, and thus prevented us from quantifying the exact ratio of Y RNAs to nELAVL. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate that up to 6% of nELAVL was bound by Y RNAs, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>. To do so, we mapped our CLIP datasets with Bowtie2, allowing multiple mapping events and reporting the best one. The amount of nELAVL bound to Y RNAs was estimated by the percentage of total nELAVL CLIP tags on Y RNAs. We conclude that Y RNAs sequester nELAVL from only a subset of nELAVL targets (85% of binding sites decreasing in AD were intronic, as assessed by annotation of peak locations; please see the subsection “nELAVL/Y RNA association correlates with loss of nELAVL-mediated splicing”). Consistent with this observation, nELAVL-dependent mRNA abundance regulation was not affected, and the splicing of only a subset of nELAVL regulated exons correlated with nELAVL Y RNA binding. Taken together, our data are consistent with a hypothesis that a relatively subtle and perhaps long-term effect of YRNA binding on normal nELAVL stoichiometry may underlie subtle and long term changes in nELAVL biology. We clarified these points in the current version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Why do so many Y RNAs without ELAVL binding motifs also appear to be binding?</italic> </p><p>We used a stringent definition of the nELAVL binding motif when searching Y RNA sequences (a stretch of 6 U’s, allowing a G at any position). Y RNAs that are bound by nELAVL and don’t have a motif, have a more degenerate version of the motif.</p><p>A total of 320 Y RNAs are bound by nELAVL, and we found the stringent definition of the nELAVL binding motif in 202 of these Y RNAs. We examined the 118 Y RNAs that did not fit this consensus in more detail. 91 (77%) of these Y RNAs contained the motif with an A or C instead of a G, or a 5mer version of the motif. The remaining 27 Y RNAs harbored UG rich stretches. We have added these points to the current version of the manuscript (subsection “Non-coding Y RNAs are bound by nELAVL in AD”).</p><p><italic>Can the authors connect the splicing or expression changes observed in the UV treated IMR32 cells to those seen in AD? Without this, it is difficult to make the case that the cytoplasmic relocalization of the nELAVL proteins is relevant to AD.</italic> </p><p>The splicing changes in UV treated IMR-32 cells do not significantly overlap with the splicing changes observed in AD (subsection “nELAVL/Y RNA association correlates with loss of nELAVL-mediated splicing”). This is certainly in part due to the wide difference between the two systems that were analyzed. As noted above, the splicing changes do not seem to relate to changes in the cytoplasmic fraction of nELAVL proteins. We recognize that increased nELAVL/Y RNA association may lead to nELAVL sequestration within cellular compartments in human brain or IMR-32 cells, but we were not able to generate high quality data to address this issue. We recognize the limitations and potential interest of these observations for future studies and have added this to our manuscript (subsection “Y RNPs are remodeled during UV stress”).</p><p><italic>The reviewers all felt that the authors should work to make some of these mechanistic connections between the Y RNAs and AD and thus strengthen this most interesting finding.</italic> </p><p>To prove that the increased nELAVL/Y RNA association in AD indeed sequesters nELAVL, we would have to manipulate Y RNA levels in AD patients. As this is impossible, we sought to manipulate Y RNA levels in IMR-32 cells. Since the expressed Y RNA copies are too diverse to be collectively targeted by, for example, shRNAs, we instead overexpressed Y RNAs to strengthen the mechanistic connection between Y RNAs and nELAVL sequestration. We infected IMR-32 cells with lentivirus containing Y3wt RNA (contains an nELAVL binding site) and Y3mut RNA (with a mutated nELAVL binding site), and analyzed changes in RNA regulation upon Y RNA infection. Because of similarities between different Y RNAs, we quantified the overexpression in several different ways, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref> (qPCR, Bowtie2 mapping, and direct search of Y3wt and mut sequences in raw Illumina sequencing reads). Because of the high number of endogenous Y RNAs, exogenous Y RNA overexpression led to a relatively small change in total Y3-like RNAs in Y3wt but not Y3mut infected cells. This did not change nELAVL and RO60 protein distribution (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The small increase in the pool of Y3-like RNAs did induce small effects on splicing, while Y3mut infection did not.</p><p>Importantly, the differentially spliced exons upon Y3wt expression were enriched for exons with adjacent intronic nELAVL binding sites, and this enrichment was dependent on the presence of the nELAVL-binding site in the Y RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results strengthen the mechanistic connection between Y RNA and nELAVL sequestration, and have been added to the subsection “Y RNA overexpression is linked to nELAVL sequestration from mRNA targets”.</p><p>We believe that the clarifications added to the manuscript and the addition of cell fractionation experiments, as well as an entire dataset describing the consequences of Y RNA overexpression, address the reviewers’ concerns and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p> <italic>Issues regarding the analytical methods:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The peak finding in the CLIP analysis needs to be better described. The authors refer to Licatalosi (2012), but that paper describes a relatively outmoded method of defining peaks above a gene specific background, as well as the use of the much better CIMS analysis from the Darnell and Zhang groups. It doesn't appear that CIMS analysis was used here, so what exactly was done?</italic> </p><p>While the analysis of CIMS (crosslinked-induced mutations) is indeed a further development of the initial peak analysis, CIMS analysis does not replace peak analysis. While CIMS analysis provides nucleotide resolution of RNA protein interactions, CIMS are only found in a small minority of peaks. To provide a more complete picture of nELAVL binding sites in the brain, we investigated nELAVL binding via peak analysis. We have added more information on the peak analysis in the Methods section.</p><p> <italic>2) Similarly, MEME-ChIP has been shown to not work well for RBP motif finding. Stating that the motif identified in human is in excellent agreement with that found in mouse is not very meaningful since both studies used the same MEME-ChIP analysis. The authors should investigate the use of newer tools such as Graphprot (Maticzka et al. Genome Biology 2014) or Zagros (Bahrami-Samani et al., NAR, 2015) for motif discovery.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a motif agreement solely based on MEME-ChIP would not be very meaningful. However, the motif identified in mice was verified via an independent method, in vitro binding assays (Ince-Dunn et al., 2012). We additionally followed the reviewers’ suggestion and compared a number of different tools, including the ones the reviewers suggested. We found the best independent tool to be HOMER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.salk.edu/homer/motif/">http://homer.salk.edu/homer/motif/</ext-link>), and used this to validate the motif identified with MEME-ChIP. The newly identified motif was very similar to the previously identified motif and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, are the peak numbers in different regions normalized for the lengths of the different types of sequences?</italic> </p><p>No, the peak numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> are not normalized for region length. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, where we show the peak distribution normalized for region length. As expected, the peak distribution changes significantly when normalized for regions length, and 3’UTRs show a far higher per-nucleotide density compared to other regions. The result has been added to the text.</p><p> <italic>4) There are also normalization questions regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1E</xref> and other plots. These plots show correlation between CLIP peaks and tags with mRNA abundance as measured by sequence reads per gene. This is problematic on several levels. First, both CLIP and RNAseq reads will be strongly affected by gene length. A better comparison is to use CLIP clusters per unit length of gene vs RPKM from RNAseq, which will normalize both values by gene length. Second even with length normalization, CLIP clusters will automatically vary strongly with gene expression level. A true comparison would need to look at the distributions of sequence density for genes in the CLIP and RNAseq datasets.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this way of normalization. We have now normalized each binding site for sequence density (rpkm), before summarizing binding sites per transcript (or per 3’UTR or introns). We have therefore redefined top targets (about two third of the top targets overlapped with previously defined top targets), as well as top 3’UTR in the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors use the human genome release hg18 for their alignments, although the conclusions do not likely depend on the genome release. Most people in the field are using the now 6-year-old hg19 and it would make it much easier for others to use these results if the authors were to update their pipelines to hg19.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the use of the hg19 build would be more appropriate at this point. To address this point and make our datasets more useful to a wider audience, we added hg19 coordinates of all supplied genomic coordinates using the UCSC liftover tool. We hope the reviewers will agree with us that the amount of time it would take us to remap the large number of datasets, and re-do the entire analysis as well as all of the tables and figures, is not justified by the relatively minor improvement in data usage compared with the liftover we included in this revised version. We would also like to emphasize that all raw sequences have been deposited at GEO for future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
