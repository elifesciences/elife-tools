"<p>All animals, including humans, evolved in a world filled with bacteria. Although bacteria are most familiar as pathogens, some bacteria produce small molecules that are essential for the biology of animals and other eukaryotes, although the details of the ways in which these bacterial molecules are beneficial are not well understood.</p><p>The choanoflagellates are water-dwelling organisms that use their whip-like flagella to move around, feeding on bacteria. They can exist as one cell or a colony of multiple cells and, perhaps surprisingly, are the closest known living relatives of animals. This means that experiments on these organisms have the potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition from egg to embryo to adult.</p><p>Alegado <italic>et al</italic>. have explored how the morphology of <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta,</italic> a colony-forming choanoflagellate, is influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria. In particular, they find that the development of multicellularity in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> is triggered by the presence of the bacterium <italic>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</italic> as well as its close relatives. They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to be C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>64</sub>NO<sub>7</sub>S; this lipid molecule is an obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in signal transmission in animals, plants, and fungi. Moreover, Alegado <italic>et al</italic>. show that <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can respond to this molecule \u2013 which they call rosette-inducing factor (RIF-1) \u2013 over a wide range of concentrations, including concentrations as low as 10<sup>\u221217</sup> M.</p><p>The work of Alegado <italic>et al</italic>. suggests that interactions between <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and <italic>Algoriphagus</italic> bacteria could be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal cell biology, and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and reception. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of multicellularity in animals.</p>"
