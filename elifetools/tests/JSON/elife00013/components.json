        "content": "Bacterially-produced small molecules exert profound influences on animal health, morphogenesis, and evolution through poorly understood mechanisms. In one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, we find that rosette colony development is induced by the prey bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis and its close relatives in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1) produced by A. machipongonensis belongs to the small class of sulfonolipids, obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play important roles in signal transmission in plants, animals, and fungi. RIF-1 has extraordinary potency (femtomolar, or 10\u221215 M) and S. rosetta can respond to it over a broad dynamic range\u2014nine orders of magnitude. This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of animals.

        "content": "All animals, including humans, evolved in a world filled with bacteria. Although bacteria are most familiar as pathogens, some bacteria produce small molecules that are essential for the biology of animals and other eukaryotes, although the details of the ways in which these bacterial molecules are beneficial are not well understood. The choanoflagellates are water-dwelling organisms that use their whip-like flagella to move around, feeding on bacteria. They can exist as one cell or a colony of multiple cells and, perhaps surprisingly, are the closest known living relatives of animals. This means that experiments on these organisms have the potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition from egg to embryo to adult. Alegado et al. have explored how the morphology of Salpingoeca rosetta, a colony-forming choanoflagellate, is influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria. In particular, they find that the development of multicellularity in S. rosetta is triggered by the presence of the bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis as well as its close relatives. They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to be C32H64NO7S; this lipid molecule is an obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in signal transmission in animals, plants, and fungi. Moreover, Alegado et al. show that S. rosetta can respond to this molecule \u2013 which they call rosette-inducing factor (RIF-1) \u2013 over a wide range of concentrations, including concentrations as low as 10\u221217 M. The work of Alegado et al. suggests that interactions between S. rosetta and Algoriphagus bacteria could be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal cell biology, and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and reception. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of multicellularity in animals.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see review process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled \u201cA bacterial sulfonolipid triggers multicellular development in the closest living relatives of animals\u201d for consideration at eLife. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of eLife's Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work. This paper reports that a bacterial sulfonolipid is able to induce colony development in a choanoflagellate. The active compound, which is produced by the bacterium in tiny amounts, turns out to be active in femtomolar concentrations. Its structure (but not its stereochemistry) is determined on the basis of extensive mass spectrometric and NMR analysis. This is a beautiful piece of work, demonstrating that this sulfonolipid produced by bacteria upon which the choanoflagellate feeds has a profound influence on the predator's development. Specifically, a particular choanoflagellate species will form rosettes, i.e., become multicellular, when certain species of Bacteroidetes are present. The researchers went on to purify and characterize the bacterial molecule responsible for this behavior in the protist. The findings should be of broad interest to the community of biologists, as it includes elements of microbiology, signaling between bacterial and eukaryotic cells that is based on molecules not before known to carry out this function, and the evolution of multicellularity in the sister group to the animals, the choanoflagellates. The work represents a major contribution to concepts about the mechanisms that may have been in play when the evolutionary step to multicellularity took place \u223c a billion years ago. The paper has implications regarding the development of eukaryotic multicellularity. The signal, a bacterial sulfonolipid, is active at remarkably low concentrations. Each of the reviewers has a few points that you should easily be able to attend to. None of these seem to be obstacles to publication. We are particularly interested in further comment on the sensitivity of the response to sulfonolipids and the fact that pure material elicits a poor response in comparison to bacterial preparations. A comment in the discussion about where the work heads from here would also be welcome. The fmolar activity of the signal seems extraordinary. Could the authors comment in the manuscript how this compares to other ultrasensitive receptors. Are there any described receptors that are more sensitive? The potency of the pure compound compared to the crude extracts is low. This received comment in the manuscript. The authors conclude that it is how the signal is delivered-as a pure relatively hydrophobic compound vs in the context of the bacterial membrane. This is one possibility. It could also be that there is a second signal required for full potency- one that is inactive in the absence of sulfonolipid. We don't know yet about the receptors. Did the authors try any kind of reconstitution experiments that might speak to the hypothesis that potency of sulfonolipids is dependent on the context of delivery? One shortcoming in this work, from an organic chemist's point of view, is that the three-dimensional structure of the signalling molecule has not been defined. With four asymmetric centers in the structure, that means that the active molecule is one of sixteen stereochemical possibilities. So, there is more to be done, and if this research group does not do it quickly, some other organic chemical research group will certainly do it for them!",

        "content": "We are grateful to the reviewers and editors for their thorough consideration of our manuscript and constructive recommendations for revision. In response to comments made in the general assessment of the manuscript, our revisions include: 1) Discussion of other signaling systems with ultrasensitive receptors. Namely, we draw the attention of readers to the well-described silkworm moth sex pheromone signaling system, in which 4 fM bombykol (the silkworm moth sex pheromone) is sufficient to induce a behavioral response in males. The potency of bombykol is comparable to that of RIF-1, which is active at concentrations ranging from 10-2 fM to 107 fM. 2) An expanded discussion of the difference in activity between purified RIF-1 vs. the sphingolipid-enriched fraction. We clarify that the difference in activity could be due either to delivery issues (i.e. a requirement for RIF-1 to be delivered in the context of the bacterial membrane) or to the absence of other currently unidentified A. machipongonensis molecules that either amplify RIF-1 signaling or might independently induce colony development in S. rosetta. In addition, we state that \u201cWe hypothesize that RIF-1 may be released into the environment in membrane vesicles, which have been described in Gram-negative bacteria and Bacteroidetes and that additional membrane constituents might be required for the full potency of RIF-1.\u201d 3) A more detailed discussion of future directions for this research, including (as pointed out by the reviewers) the need to determine the three-dimensional structure of RIF-1. Note that defining the stereochemistry will require synthesizing several different possible stereoisomers of RIF-1, and that there are no published total syntheses of any sulfonolipids in the literature.",
