        "content": "Drosophila central neurons arise from neuroblasts that generate neurons in a pair-wise fashion, with the two daughters providing the basis for distinct A and B hemilineage groups. 33 postembryonically-born hemilineages contribute over 90% of the neurons in each thoracic hemisegment. We devised genetic approaches to define the anatomy of most of these hemilineages and to assessed their functional roles using the heat-sensitive channel dTRPA1. The simplest hemilineages contained local interneurons and their activation caused tonic or phasic leg movements lacking interlimb coordination. The next level was hemilineages of similar projection cells that drove intersegmentally coordinated behaviors such as walking. The highest level involved hemilineages whose activation elicited complex behaviors such as takeoff. These activation phenotypes indicate that the hemilineages vary in their behavioral roles with some contributing to local networks for sensorimotor processing and others having higher order functions of coordinating these local networks into complex behavior.

        "content": "The legs and wings of insects are borne on the middle body segments, which make up the thorax. The nervous system inside of the thorax is part of the insect equivalent of the spinal cord and contains clusters of interneurons that relay signals between the sensory nerves, the brain and the muscles. This enables the insect to perform complex actions such as walking and flying. The thoracic interneurons are produced by a fixed set of stem cells. Each stem cell makes neurons in a pair-wise fashion by producing a sequence of neural progenitor cells, each of which then divides to produce two different types of daughter neurons. All of the daughter neurons of the same type are said to belong to the same hemilineage, and in the fruit fly Drosophila, the majority of the interneurons in the thorax are from one of 33 hemilineages. Each interneuron cluster in the insect thorax is made up of cells from a single hemilineage. Harris et al. developed genetic tools that allow the different hemilineages in the Drosophila thorax to be labeled, and used this to create a set of flies that allows the role of the different clusters to be investigated. Each fly type was modified so that increasing the temperature activated a heat-sensitive channel in the neurons of a single hemilineage, and Harris et al. recorded the behavioral response this produced. Each hemilineage caused the fly to move in a distinctive way when stimulated, and many of these movements were unique to a single cluster. Furthermore, the hemilineages can be divided into different groups based on their complexity. Activating the simplest group of hemilineage clusters produces simple movements such as leg twitches and stretches. Another group of hemilineages are then able to organize these movements into more complicated behaviors, such as walking. The third, most complex, hemilineages can coordinate several complex actions to enable the flies to perform very complicated tasks, like take off for flight. These findings suggest that hemilineages act as the basic modules of the nervous system in the fly thorax. Furthermore, the flies and techniques developed by Harris et al. will provide valuable resources for future studies into the organization and function of the nervous system.

(E) Frames of a high-speed video of a decapitated fly taking-off during heating. Flapping often began prior to wing raising causing the wings to bend (8ms, 25ms). (F\u2013I) Hemilineage 19A. (F, G) The 19A clusters are posterior dorsolateral in the segment and project arbor into the ventral leg neuropil and also to a convergence point at the midline just below the tectulum. This convergence point shows nSyt-GFP (magenta) localization (H, arrow). (I) Video frames from early and midway through the heat ramp. With increased temperature the flies extend their T2 legs and begin to wave them. The frames for a one second period (18\u201319 s) are superimposed to illustrate movements of the T2 legs (arrow) and stability of the others. (J, K) Hemilineage 19B. (K, L) The major representation of the 19A cells are in the T2 cluster located posterior dorsolateral region of the segment, with a smaller cluster in T3. The axons cross in a posterior commissure and show medial (m) and lateral (l) anterior projections that are confined to the tectulum. The line had massive contamination from haltere afferents (*). (L\u2013N) Hemilineages 20A, 22A. (L, M) The cell bodies for the 20A, 22A clusters are in the posterior ventrolateral region of the segment and the neurons innervate the middle third of the leg neuropil. (N) Video frames of decapitated flies showing that they splay out their legs as the temperature rises. (O\u2013Q) Hemilineage 21A. (O, P) The 21A clusters are in the posterior ventrolateral region of the segment. They project dorsomedially and then arborize over most of the dorsal two-thirds of the leg neuropil. (Q) Video frames of decapitated flies during the heat ramp. Eventually the flies become immobile with their legs frozen at unusual angles (21 s). The frames for an intermediate, one second period (10\u201311 s) are superimposed to show the transient hyperkinetic leg movements. (R\u2013T) Hemilineage 23B. (R, S) The 23B clusters are in the posterior dorsolateral region of the segment. The neurons produce an extensive ipsilateral arbor and then cross the posterior commissure for their output arbor. (T) Stimulation of the 23B neurons produce uncoordinated leg movements and the flies basically stay in place (36\u00b0C). (U\u2013W) Hemilineage 24. (U, V) The smaller of the two motor lineages. Cell bodies are located in the anterodorsolateral region of the segment and the neurons innervate primarily proximal leg muscles. (W) Video frames of decapitated flies subjected to a heat ramp. At elevated temperatures the flies typically showed repetitive leg movements. Genotypes. For most genotypes see Supplementary file 1; for the remainder: (I) UAS-nSyt-GFP (attp18)/w; UAS-RFP(attP40)/+: R32E04_GAL4 (attP2).",

        "content": "eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see review process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for sending your work entitled \u201cNeuron hemilineages are functional modules of the Drosophila Ventral Nervous System\u201d for consideration at eLife. Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Leslie Griffith, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission: While all the reviewers were very positive about this work, there was common concern about the level of description of both the anatomy and the behavioral phenotypes. This paper has the potential to be foundational for future studies of locomotor circuits, but to be useful to the field it must contain more information than it currently does. There are three areas that need to be expanded. 1) Anatomy. It is important to put the anatomy of the hemilineages, as visualized by the drivers, in context with the lineage labeled as a clone. These clones, and the pattern of neuroglian-positive tracts in the adult, have been described in the dissertation of the lead author, which is cited. It is difficult to compare the hemilineage projection patterns shown in this paper (which are presented as a single z-projection along the entire thickness of the VNS) with the clone data in Dr. Harris' thesis. More room should be given in the anatomy section of this paper to these aspects. The clones in relationship to hemilineages should be shown; logically they should encompass the two sister hemilineages labeled by drivers. If this is not always the case, it is an important fact to document. 2) Off-target cells. How was the \u201csuccess of a genotype in generating a pure hemilineage\u201d calculated? Were clones used as a comparison? The lack of information on clones (above) becomes an issue here. The only figure where the hemilineages are shown registered to a common template is the schematic Discussion Figure 8A. This figure, and the raw data underlying it (i.e., registering the hemilineage patterns to a template) should be part of this paper. It might be good to show more clearly how the current hemilineage labeling strategies compare to MARCM labeled clones with regard to targeting Gal4/LexA activity to entire hemilineages. This would also address the question of off-target cells. The aggregate information (with numbers for each line, not simply descriptors) could be presented in table format. 3) Behavior. The behavioral phenotypes need to be documented more precisely in Figures 4 and 5. In many cases the reader cannot extract the author's conclusions from viewing the figures. For example, there is no figure panel that convincingly shows flies lacking interlimb coordination \u2013 one of their conclusions. High speed recordings with frames documenting each movement would provide the required information, perhaps with a simplified stick figure summary of the leg/joint movements. It would also be interesting to discuss the fact that all hemilineages generated motor output. Are there no inhibitory neurons in the thorax? Are they embedded within excitatory populations in each hemilineage?",

More room should be given in the anatomy section of this paper to these aspects. The clones in relationship to hemilineages should be shown; logically they should encompass the two sister hemilineages labeled by drivers. If this is not always the case, it is an important fact to document. We have expanded the anatomical aspects of the paper with a more detailed dorsal view and cross-section projections of each hemilineage. In terms of MARCM clones, a few have already been published (Brown and Truman) and we have added a few supplemental figures of MARCM clones for some of the complex lineages. A comprehensive treatment showing MARCM clones for all of the lineages and how they vary in each of the three thoracic segments is being prepared (Shepherd, Sahota, Court, Harris, Truman and Williams, in preparation) but adding this amount of data would be beyond the scope of this paper. 2) Off-target cells. How was the \u201csuccess of a genotype in generating a pure hemilineage\u201d calculated? Were clones used as a comparison? The lack of information on clones (above) becomes an issue here.

This would also address the question of off-target cells. The aggregate information (with numbers for each line, not simply descriptors) could be presented in table format. The clone paper cited above includes registering the clones onto a common template. Although the MARCM clone analysis was started by Dr. Harris, it was substantially expanded and carried to completing after her death. Consequently, we think it should be a separate paper. For the purpose of the present paper, our first concern was that we were getting the members of one hemilineage but none of the members of its sister hemilineage. We met this goal in all cases. Supplemental file 1 documents the amount of non-hemilineage contamination for each line. We accepted lines that had some scattered weak expressing cells in the thorax. We were more tolerant of accepting expression in abdominal interneurons. Lines with prominent sensory expression were not used. As described in the text, we also controlled for the effects of descending axons when such were present. 3) Behavior. The behavioral phenotypes need to be documented more precisely in Figures 4 and 5. In many cases the reader cannot extract the author's conclusions from viewing the figures. For example, there is no figure panel that convincingly shows flies lacking interlimb coordination \u2013 one of their conclusions. High speed recordings with frames documenting each movement would provide the required information, perhaps with a simplified stick figure summary of the leg/joint movements. It would also be interesting to discuss the fact that all hemilineages generated motor output. Are there no inhibitory neurons in the thorax? Are they embedded within excitatory populations in each hemilineage? Details of the behavioral responses have been expanded with a description for each hemilineage and a supplementary video showing the behavioral responses of the decapitated flies to the heat ramp. We only have fragmentary transmitter data for the hemilineages at present. In some cases, though, such as for hemilineage 12B, we know that all of the members are GABA immunoreactive. Stimulating these cells results in tonic leg extension.",
