"<p>Proteins are built based on instructions in template molecules called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs), which are copied from the DNA of genes. As they are made, proteins must fold into a specific three-dimensional shape and some proteins pass into a compartment in the cell, called the endoplasmic reticulum, in which they fold. So-called molecular chaperone proteins assist this folding process. From the endoplasmic reticulum, most proteins travel to other destinations within or outside of the cell.</p><p>If the molecular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum are overwhelmed by their protein folding task, unfolded proteins accumulate; a situation that can be harmful to the cell. In eukaryotic cells including yeast, a sensor protein called Ire1 detects when unfolded proteins build up in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the Ire1 sensor proteins join together to form clusters and an mRNA molecule called <italic>HAC1</italic> is specifically recruited to the Ire1 clusters. The portions of the Ire1 protein that extend out from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell proper then bind to <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA and cut a piece out of it. This edited mRNA encodes the instructions to build a protein that in turn boosts the expression of various components\u2014including the appropriate molecular chaperones\u2014that are needed to alleviate the stress caused by an excess of unfolded proteins.</p><p>Within clusters, individual Ire1 proteins interact through the portions of the protein found on the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum. Now, van Anken et al. show that these interactions are sufficient for forming and maintaining clusters. The interactions between the portions of the Ire1 proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum are needed for editing the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA but not for forming and maintaining the clusters or for recruiting the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA molecule to bind to Ire1. Instead, van Anken et al. discovered an mRNA binding site on the Ire1 clusters, which is separate from the part of the Ire1 protein that cuts the mRNA molecules. The Ire1 protein needs to first bind the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA molecule at this binding site before it can cut it; van Anken et al. suggest that this two-step process helps ensure accurate and efficient editing of the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA by Ire1. This process could also help to minimize the chance of other mRNA molecules being edited by mistake.</p><p>It will be of interest to investigate if similar safety measures are key for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling mechanisms in humans, and whether these newly discovered steps can be targeted by drugs to treat disease.</p>"
