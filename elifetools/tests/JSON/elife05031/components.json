        "content": "Insufficient protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). In the ER lumen, accumulation of unfolded proteins activates the transmembrane ER-stress sensor Ire1 and drives its oligomerization. In the cytosol, Ire1 recruits HAC1 mRNA, mediating its non-conventional splicing. The spliced mRNA is translated into Hac1, the key transcription activator of UPR target genes that mitigate ER-stress. In this study, we report that oligomeric assembly of the ER-lumenal domain is sufficient to drive Ire1 clustering. Clustering facilitates Ire1's cytosolic oligomeric assembly and HAC1 mRNA docking onto a positively charged motif in Ire1's cytosolic linker domain that tethers the kinase/RNase to the transmembrane domain. By the use of a synthetic bypass, we demonstrate that mRNA docking per se is a pre-requisite for initiating Ire1's RNase activity and, hence, splicing. We posit that such step-wise engagement between Ire1 and its mRNA substrate contributes to selectivity and efficiency in UPR signaling. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05031.001",

        "content": "Proteins are built based on instructions in template molecules called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs), which are copied from the DNA of genes. As they are made, proteins must fold into a specific three-dimensional shape and some proteins pass into a compartment in the cell, called the endoplasmic reticulum, in which they fold. So-called molecular chaperone proteins assist this folding process. From the endoplasmic reticulum, most proteins travel to other destinations within or outside of the cell. If the molecular chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum are overwhelmed by their protein folding task, unfolded proteins accumulate; a situation that can be harmful to the cell. In eukaryotic cells including yeast, a sensor protein called Ire1 detects when unfolded proteins build up in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the Ire1 sensor proteins join together to form clusters and an mRNA molecule called HAC1 is specifically recruited to the Ire1 clusters. The portions of the Ire1 protein that extend out from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cell proper then bind to HAC1 mRNA and cut a piece out of it. This edited mRNA encodes the instructions to build a protein that in turn boosts the expression of various components\u2014including the appropriate molecular chaperones\u2014that are needed to alleviate the stress caused by an excess of unfolded proteins. Within clusters, individual Ire1 proteins interact through the portions of the protein found on the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum. Now, van Anken et al. show that these interactions are sufficient for forming and maintaining clusters. The interactions between the portions of the Ire1 proteins outside of the endoplasmic reticulum are needed for editing the HAC1 mRNA but not for forming and maintaining the clusters or for recruiting the HAC1 mRNA molecule to bind to Ire1. Instead, van Anken et al. discovered an mRNA binding site on the Ire1 clusters, which is separate from the part of the Ire1 protein that cuts the mRNA molecules. The Ire1 protein needs to first bind the HAC1 mRNA molecule at this binding site before it can cut it; van Anken et al. suggest that this two-step process helps ensure accurate and efficient editing of the HAC1 mRNA by Ire1. This process could also help to minimize the chance of other mRNA molecules being edited by mistake. It will be of interest to investigate if similar safety measures are key for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling mechanisms in humans, and whether these newly discovered steps can be targeted by drugs to treat disease.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see review process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for sending your work entitled \u201cSpecificity in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling entails a step-wise engagement of HAC1 mRNA to Ire1 clusters\u201d for consideration at eLife. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. All three comment on the significance of the work and mark it as a worthwhile advance. The review process also uncovered several deficiencies in your paper that should be remedied before publication. These are listed below. The authors state: \u201cSurprisingly, we found that residual targeting of HAC1 mRNA occurs even in the absence of recognizable features conserved among Ire1 proteins at the cytosolic side of the membrane (ire1\u0394KR/\u0394[+]-box), as long as the mRNA contained the 3' BE motif and was translationally repressed.\u201d It is debatable if dependence on the 3'BE and on translational repression has been rigorously demonstrated. It would be important to show that the residual targeting is diminished when Hac1 mRNA lacks the 3'BE. Figure 5 shows that the U1A-mediated targeting of Hac1 to Ire1 can partially compensate for the loss of the (+) box in Ire1 (comparing lanes 4 and 5). But even in this context the 3'BE is doing something to enhance splicing (lanes 5, 6). Given the focus of the paper on the interplay of RNA and protein motives in Hac1 mRNA targeting, it would be important to establish if U1A targeting can also compensate for the loss of the 3'BE: what does the splicing/tuni sensitivity look like for delta-3'BE when the U1A is not present in Ire1? Is splicing completely blocked (as with the delta+ box?)? mRNA reporter assays and foci formation assays were done in the presence of 2 mM or 10 mM DTT while survival/growth assay were done in the presence of tunicamycin. Authors should provide the survival assays in the presence of DTT and foci formation and mRNA reporter assay in the presence of tunicamycin to determine if the phenomena is specific to DTT or is a general mechanism of ER stress resolution. Alternately, authors should provide a reasonable explanation why such experiments are not necessary. The rationale for using various different ER inducers at different concentrations: tunicamycin (0.2 \u00b5g/ml) for Figure 1f; 2 mM DTT for Figure 1D; and 10 mM of DTT for Figure 1g for different times of incubation needs to be explained.",

It would be important to show that the residual targeting is diminished when Hac1 mRNA lacks the 3'BE. The reviewers are correct that the present study does not rigorously demonstrate the dependence on the 3'BE and translational repression. However, we demonstrated this fact rigorously in our previous publication (Figure 2i and 4 in Aragon et al. (2009)). Consistent with these previous findings, in Figure 5a of the present study we observed no mRNA recruitment even for WT Ire1 in the absence of the 3'BE. Since recruitment is already down to background levels for WT Ire1, it is not plausible that ire1 \u0394KR/\u0394[+]-box might recruit an mRNA lacking the 3'BE. We have further clarified this point in the text. Figure 5 shows that the U1A-mediated targeting of Hac1 to Ire1 can partially compensate for the loss of the (+) box in Ire1 (comparing lanes 4 and 5). But even in this context the 3'BE is doing something to enhance splicing (lanes 5, 6). Given the focus of the paper on the interplay of RNA and protein motives in Hac1 mRNA targeting, it would be important to establish if U1A targeting can also compensate for the loss of the 3'BE; what does the splicing/tuni sensitivity look like for delta-3'BE when the U1A is not present in Ire1? Is splicing completely blocked (as with the delta+ box?)? The reviewers are correct that this is a very important point. In fact, we performed the exact experiment the referees suggest in our previous publication (Figure 1b,e in Aragon et al. (2009)): a strain expressing WT Ire1 and HAC1 mRNA lacking the 3\u2019BE has a growth defect in ER stress conditions compared to WT. The reduction in splicing efficiency we now see upon removal of the 3\u2019BE with the U1A \u2018bypass\u2019 is commensurate with the reduction seen for WT Ire1 upon removal of the 3\u2019BE from HAC1 mRNA. We now clarify and stress this point in the text. mRNA reporter assays and foci formation assays were done in the presence of 2 mM or 10 mM DTT while survival/growth assay were done in the presence of tunicamycin. Authors should provide the survival assays in the presence of DTT and foci formation and mRNA reporter assay in the presence of tunicamycin to determine if the phenomena is specific to DTT or is a general mechanism of ER stress resolution. Alternately, authors should provide a reasonable explanation why such experiments are not necessary. The rationale for using various different ER inducers at different concentrations: tunicamycin (0.2 \u00b5g/ml) for Figure 1f; 2 mM DTT for Figure 1D; and 10 mM of DTT for Figure 1g for different times of incubation needs to be explained. This point is well taken. Importantly, in Aragon et al. (2009) Figure S2, Figure 3a, we monitored clustering in the presence of tunicamycin and DTT, and we showed that both stressors induce similar foci, though with different kinetics. There are three reasons we use 5 mM DTT for imaging and biochemical assays and 0.2 \u03bcg/ml tunicamycin for survival assays: 1) Since tunicamycin affects only newly synthesized proteins as it blocks de novo N-glycosylation, it takes longer to induce ER stress than DTT, which breaks disulfide bonds of already-synthesized ER clients. Thus, for assessing foci formation DTT is more suitable. 2) For the survival assay, strong ER stress will not reveal differences in UPR signaling efficiency. If we were to use 5 mM DTT in plate assays even the WT would be dead. The survival is measured after 3 days, whereas the clustering is measured after 1 hr. The 0.2 \u03bcg/ml tunicamycin concentration has been used widely in the field as it has been empirically established as a concentration at which ER stress is tolerable to WT cells but toxic to UPR mutants. 3) DTT in plate survival assays is not ideal as it oxidizes over time unless the medium is kept at a low pH. Tunicamycin in contrast is stable over longer periods of time. Using stabilized DTT would impose an acidic shock on top of the ER stress. We now stress in the Methods that we established empirically that 5 mM DTT gives robust ER stress that is ideal for assessing clustering and mRNA recruitment, while 0.2 \u03bcg/ml tunicamycin is most suitable to score how mutants in UPR signaling efficiency affect growth. Dr Peter Rodgers adds: \u201cWe feel that the following title would be more understandable: Specificity in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling entails a step-wise engagement of HAC1 mRNA to clusters of the stress sensor Ire1\u201d We have changed the title according to Peter Rodgers\u2019 excellent suggestion.",
