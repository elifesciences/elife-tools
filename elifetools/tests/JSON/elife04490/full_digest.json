"<p>Plants are at the base of many food webs. This means that the different traits and characteristics of the plant species in an ecosystem can have a large impact on the animals and other organisms that live there.</p><p>Individuals within the same plant species often differ in multiple genes. This \u2018genetic diversity\u2019 can affect the populations of other organisms in their ecosystem, for example, by altering which species are present, and the number of individuals. However, previous studies that investigated plant genetic diversity in ecosystems used plants that varied in multiple, usually unknown, genetic traits, which made it difficult to identify specific genetic traits in plants that can influence the whole ecosystem.</p><p>One way that plants affect their ecosystems involves how they defend themselves against the herbivores that try to eat them. For example, plants can use sharp spines or harmful chemicals to deter herbivores, or attract predators that will attack the herbivores.</p><p>Here, Schuman et al. carried out a 2-year field study using wild tobacco plants that had been genetically altered to employ different defensive strategies. This was achieved by altering the expression of three genes in the plants in specific combinations. Two of the genes, called <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic>, are required to make most of the chemicals that tobacco plants use to defend themselves against herbivores. The third gene, called <italic>TPS10</italic>, which comes from the crop plant maize, gives plants the ability to release a fragrance that attracts natural predators of their herbivores.</p><p>Except for these specific alterations, the plants were otherwise genetically identical. These plants were then grown either alone, or in groups of five plants, which reflects the normal size of groups of wild tobacco growing in its natural environment. The groups contained mixtures of plants with different gene alterations.</p><p>Schuman et al. found that the expression levels of these genes in individual plants could determine how well the whole group fared in several different measures of plant health and defense. For example, plants lacking <italic>LOX2</italic> and <italic>LOX3</italic> usually appeared to be less healthy and they were less likely to survive long enough to reproduce because they were less able to defend themselves against herbivores. However, if these plants were grown in a group with one plant that expressed <italic>TPS10</italic>, all of the plants in the group looked healthier and were more likely to survive long enough to reproduce.</p><p>Many crops are grown in large fields containing individual plants that are largely genetically identical, which makes them more vulnerable to disease. Schuman et al.'s findings suggest that some of the community-level protective effects provided by diversity in wild populations of plants could be introduced into crop fields by altering the expression of a few specific genes in some individuals.</p>"
