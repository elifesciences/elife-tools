        "content": "Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is essential for gene silencing, establishing transcriptional repression of specific genes by tri-methylating Lysine 27 of histone H3, a process mediated by cofactors such as AEBP2. In spite of its biological importance, little is known about PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions. The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2 that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the methyltransferase site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the chromatin-based regulation of PRC2 activity.

        "content": "Protein complexes\u2014stable structures that contain two or more proteins\u2014have an important role in the biochemical processes that are associated with the expression of genes. Some help to silence genes, whereas others are involved in the activation of genes. The importance of such complexes is emphasized by the fact that mice die as embryos, or are born with serious defects, if they do not possess the protein complex known as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, or PRC2 for short. It is known that the core of this complex, which is found in species that range from Drosophila to humans, is composed of four different proteins, and that the structures of two of these have been determined with atomic precision. It is also known that PRC2 requires a particular protein co-factor (called AEBP2) to perform this function. Moreover, it has been established that PRC2 silences genes by adding two or three methyl (CH3) groups to a particular amino acid (Lysine 27) in one of the proteins (histone H3) that DNA strands wrap around in the nucleus of cells. However, despite its biological importance, little is known about the detailed architecture of PRC2. Ciferri et al. shed new light on the structure of this complex by using electron microscopy to produce the first three-dimensional image of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor. By incorporating various protein tags into the co-factor and the four subunits of the PRC2, and by employing mass spectrometry and other techniques, Ciferri et al. were able to identify 60 or so interaction sites within the PRC2-cofactor system, and to determine their locations within the overall structure. The results show that the cofactor stabilizes the architecture of the complex by binding to it at a central hinge point. In particular, the protein domains within the PRC2 that interact with the histone markers are close to the site that transfer the methyl groups, which helps to explain how the gene silencing activity of the PRC2 complex is regulated. The results should pave the way to a more complete understanding of how PRC2 and its cofactor are able to silence genes. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00005.002",

        "content": "eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see review process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled \u201cMolecular architecture of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2\u201d for consideration at eLife. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of eLife's Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. Our goal is to provide the essential revision requirements as a single set of instructions, so that you have a clear view of the revisions that are necessary for us to publish your work. The work presented by C. Ciferri aims to determine the molecular organization of the Polycomb Repressive complex 2 bound to its cofactor AEBP. The recombinant complex produced in insect cells was characterized biochemically and analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy to determine a 3-D model of the assembly at 21 \u00c5 resolution. Cross-linking experiments combined with mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify at the sequence level the most prominent protein-protein contacts. Furthermore a large number of complexes were produced, each carrying a large protein tag at a different position in order to identify and position the constituent proteins and several of their domains in the 3-D envelope. This structural characterization allowed a clear positioning of existing atomic structures or homology models of the complex components. PRC2 is of fundamental importance and high interest, and this structure is a very significant advance over previous high-resolution structures of isolated domains of 2 PRC2 components. The authors make a number of suggestions to provide a structural basis for previous biochemical observations. These include how the enzymatic activity is affected by modifications of the H3 tail, as well as the stabilization of the complex by the AEBP1 cofactor. These inferences about biochemical function are speculative given the resolution of the structure. The work is of very high quality and despite using negative stained particles instead of cryo EM, it reaches important conclusions supported by redundant and accurate information. The conclusions drawn about the shape of the complex, the location of the different subunits and the relative orientation of the subunits are sound and convincing. The cross-linking experiments confirm the structural conclusions Concerns to be addressed during revision: *The original images show a heterogeneous population of particles and in particular smaller particles that suggest that some particles may dissociate. We also notice that little information is given regarding the stoichiometry of the complex. However the data is consistent and convincing. The authors should describe whether all particles were considered or whether some were rejected. If the latter was the case, the rejection criteria should be communicated. *The conclusions of the manuscript, and in particular the functional consequences for the interaction of PCR2 with nucleosomes, are highly speculative. The histone tails that interact with the WD40 repeats of PCR2 are extremely flexible and one cannot conclude at this stage that PRC2 will bind between two adjacent nucleosomes. A part of the discussion concerns the interaction with the so-called linker histone H1. H1 interacts mainly through its globular domain with the dyad axis of the core nucleosome and has little interaction, except for its N-and C termini with the linker DNA. Once bound to nucleosomes, H1 induces an important condensation of the chromatin and it is unlikely that PCR2 can still bind between two successive nucleosomes. Therefore this part of the discussion should be removed. *Based on the combined results, the authors make a number of suggestions to provide a structural basis for previous biochemical observations. These include how the enzymatic activity is affected by modifications of the H3 tail, as well as the stabilization of the complex by AEBP1. These inferences about biochemical function are speculative given the resolution of the structure. *We were wondering why only 20 classes were considered for the Random Conical Tilt method. If the complexes were homogeneous this would correspond to an angular difference of 40 or 50 degrees between classes which is a large merging angle and would lead to a rather poor resolution. If several different conformations were to be considered an even larger merging angle would be considered. The authors should justify why only 20 classes were reconstructed.",

        "content": "\u2022The original images show a heterogeneous population of particles and in particular smaller particles that suggest that some particles may dissociate. We also notice that little information is given regarding the stoichiometry of the complex. However the data is consistent and convincing. The authors should describe whether all particles were considered or whether some were rejected. If the latter was the case, the rejection criteria should be communicated. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the omission of this section of the text. The manuscript now includes this information in the results section. We mentioned that, as we affinity purified the PRC2-ABP2 complex using a Strep tag onto AEBP2, we cannot exclude the presence of a small excess of this subunit in our preparation. Regarding the EM images, we noticed the presence of smaller particles. We interpreted them as either end-on views or partial complexes, most likely the AEBP2 itself, being used for tag-based purification. Those particles were consequently not considered during the 3D data processing, and we relied on a good \u201ctomographic\u201d coverage of the views around the long axis of the structure. It should also be noted that the labeling studies clearly indicate that the structure described contains all the subunits. \u2022The conclusions of the manuscript, and in particular the functional consequences for the interaction of PCR2 with nucleosomes, are highly speculative. The histone tails that interact with the WD40 repeats of PCR2 are extremely flexible and one cannot conclude at this stage that PRC2 will bind between two adjacent nucleosomes. A part of the discussion concerns the interaction with the so-called linker histone H1. H1 interacts mainly through its globular domain with the dyad axis of the core nucleosome and has little interaction, except for its N-and C termini with the linker DNA. Once bound to nucleosomes, H1 induces an important condensation of the chromatin and it is unlikely that PCR2 can still bind between two successive nucleosomes. Therefore this part of the discussion should be removed. We thank the reviewer for pointing out the issues in this part of the discussion. We have now completely removed the portion regarding the Histone H1 binding and rephrased, in a more cautious and succinct way, the section concerning the nucleosome binding. We still indicate that our structure does suggest a possible arrangement of the PRC2 complex during di-nucleosome binding, which makes sense sterically and is the most parsimonious given the localization of the histone tail-binding regions at opposite ends of the complex. We summarized these ideas in just a single paragraph and describe it in an additional figure (Figure 13) that was extracted from the previous Figure 12 (now simplified), and that lacks the reference to H1. \u2022Based on the combined results, the authors make a number of suggestions to provide a structural basis for previous biochemical observations. These include how the enzymatic activity is affected by modifications of the H3 tail, as well as the stabilization of the complex by AEBP1. These inferences about biochemical function are speculative given the resolution of the structure. We understand the concerns of the reviewers. And while we do agree that at the resolution of the structure we present here we cannot describe specific mechanistic details concerning single amino acid interactions, which will only come when atomic details are available, our present work still represents a huge step forward that allows, for the first time, to place previous biochemical data into an architectural framework of PRC2. During the past few years, work from different labs have shown how the enzymatic activity of PRC2 is affected by modifications of Histone H3. It has also been shown how the binding of AEBP2 affects and increases its activity. In this paper we describe the first molecular organization of the PRC2 complex and how AEBP2 interacts with different regions of the complex. In the discussion section we are simply placing the published biochemical data in the framework of the structure and protein connections we have visualized. This is something that could not be done before and that opens new questions and testable models. We believe that the localization we describe here does lead to a parsimonious explanation of biochemical data that we truly feel should be indicated at this point. To address the reviewers\u2019 concerns we have revised the text to clarify how far the present data takes us, making clear where we are just placing biochemical data into a physical context, and when we are extrapolating, in a logical way, to propose testable models that really build on our new structural data, always keeping in mind the resolution limitation. \u2022We were wondering why only 20 classes were considered for the Random Conical Tilt method. If the complexes were homogeneous this would correspond to an angular difference of 40 or 50 degrees between classes which is a large merging angle and would lead to a rather poor resolution. If several different conformations were to be considered an even larger merging angle would be considered. The authors should justify why only 20 classes were reconstructed. We made 20 classes based on the number of tilt pairs we had, since this number could distribute the dataset into classes that had an appropriate number of particles for a reconstruction with enough signal and at a resolution that was sufficient to serve as an initial model for projection matching. Had we made more classes, then the RCT reconstructions would have had much fewer particles, and not been interpretable. As we relied on a good \u201ctomographic\u201d coverage of the views around the long axis of the structure, we were expecting to have a coverage of about 18 degrees from the 20 classes (360/20). We believe this was a good compromise between angular spread and signal. A proof of this principle was that our strategy actually worked, generating an RCT 3D model from which reprojections matched well our reference free 2D classes, and that ultimately aided to refine our untilted data to 21 \u00c5.",
