        "content": "The clathrin adaptor complex AP2 is thought to be an obligate heterotetramer. We identify null mutations in the \u03b1 subunit of AP2 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. \u03b1-adaptin mutants are viable and the remaining \u03bc2/\u03b2 hemicomplex retains some function. Conversely, in \u03bc2 mutants, the alpha/sigma2 hemicomplex is localized and is partially functional. \u03b1-\u03bc2 double mutants disrupt both halves of the complex and are lethal. The lethality can be rescued by expression of AP2 components in the skin, which allowed us to evaluate the requirement for AP2 subunits at synapses. Mutations in either \u03b1 or \u03bc2 subunits alone reduce the number of synaptic vesicles by about 30%; however, simultaneous loss of both \u03b1 and \u03bc2 subunits leads to a 70% reduction in synaptic vesicles and the presence of large vacuoles. These data suggest that AP2 may function as two partially independent hemicomplexes. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00190.001",

        "content": "The cell membrane is a busy place, with cell-surface proteins continually added and removed according to the needs of the cell. Each protein extends a polypeptide tail into the cell cytoplasm. When a protein is to be removed from the cell surface, its tail recruits a protein complex known as the AP2 adaptor to the membrane. AP2 then recruits a coat protein called clathrin, which forms a spherical scaffold around the adaptor, the target protein and the surrounding membrane, enclosing them inside a vesicle that breaks off from the membrane and enters the cell. Endocytosis is particularly common in neurons, which use it as a means of recycling proteins at synapses\u2014the contact points between nerve cells. However, it is unclear whether synaptic-vesicle recycling also involves clathrin and AP2. To address this question, Gu et al. examined mutant nematode worms (C. elegans) in which the composition of AP2 had been altered. AP2 has four subunits, called \u03b1, \u03b22, \u03bc2 and \u03c32, and Gu et al. produced worms that lack either the \u03b1- or \u03bc2-subunit, or both. Few worms that lacked both subunits survived. Surprisingly, however, worms that lacked just one subunit were viable, despite previous evidence that AP2 requires all four subunits to be functional. Nevertheless, these single mutants produced 30% fewer synaptic vesicles compared to wild-type worms. To examine the consequences of both subunits being absent, Gu et al. rescued the double mutants by selectively expressing AP2 in their skin. These animals\u2014which still lack AP2 in their nervous systems\u2014produced 70% fewer synaptic vesicles than their wild-type counterparts. The results show that AP2 does not need all four of its subunits and that it can exist as two semi-independent hemicomplexes. Moreover, Gu et al. show that C. elegans uses at least two endocytotic mechanisms (AP2-dependent and independent) to recycle vesicles and so maintain synaptic function.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see review process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled \u201cAP2 subunits contribute independently to synaptic vesicle endocytosis\u201d for consideration at eLife. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of eLife's Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Graeme Davis (Reviewing editor); Tim Ryan (peer reviewer). The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports. All three of the reviewers agree that the data set is strong, particularly the diversity of approaches and strong genetic data used to demonstrate that APA-2 and APM-2 are both required for endocytosis in C. elegans. All agree that the data will appeal to a wide audience. Two reviewers are strongly supportive of the manuscript and suggest minor textual modifications. A third reviewer has suggested additional experiments and textual revisions. The additional experiments that were suggested would directly test the hemi-complex model using labeled cargos specific for each hemi-complex. While these experiments would significantly strengthen the manuscript, they are not required for publication. When revising your manuscript, please address the textual revisions suggested by each reviewer, listed below. Suggested experiments to improve the manuscript: One could imagine that different endocytic cargos could have differential sensitivity to AP2 perturbations. An experiment would be to test cargos that are solely trafficked by either hemi-complex. This could be done using chimeric CD4 proteins containing either di-leucine (as in Figure 4) or tyrosine-based endocytic motifs (which mediate binding to alpha2 and mu2 respectively). If hemi-complexes function independently, di-leucine substrate recycling would be disrupted in apa-2 (as indicated in Figure 4D) but unaffected in apm-2 (which was not tested). The converse pattern would be expected for cargos containing a tyrosine endocytic motif. In principle, these experiments could persuasively show that in mutants lacking specific subunits, the remaining AP2 subunits have the capacity to function as hemi-complexes. Required textual revisions: 1) Please revise the text to make it as clear as possible how much residual AP2 function may exist in the hemi knockouts. 2) Please discuss the contribution of hemi-complex function to the wild type animal, when all subunits are present. For example, AP2 binding to cargo endocytic motifs is activated by PIP2 binding, which is mediated by residues in both hemi-complexes. Clathrin recruitment by AP2 is mediated by clathrin binding sequences in both hemi-complexes. Native cargoes may contain motifs that bind both alpha and mu subunits. For these reasons, the avidity of the AP2 holo-complex for substrates and clathrin may be much stronger than for either hemi-complex. In addition, the authors should comment on the observation that protein abundance for the residual hemi-complex is relatively low (e.g., in the apm-2 mutants), suggesting that it would be a minor contributor to wild-type endocytic activity. This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex. 3) Please revise the text to include p-values for all data upon which arguments or conclusions are based. This is particularly important for the diverse double mutant phenotypes that appear to trend toward significance, but which may or may not reach statistical significance. This is also the case when discussing comparisons being made regarding electrophysiological data. 4) It is unclear why the authors did not report on the electrophysiological signature of the double (alpha/mu) mutant in the \u201cskin\u201d rescued animals. This is worth at least mentioning. 5) The authors should reference the mammalian work showing that loss of mu2 leads to loss of alpha and point out that this is in contrast to the findings in this system. 6) It is not possible, at the light level, to know whether an altered axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution has anything to do with the recycling of individual proteins. This should be discussed. 7) The changes in vesicle size and number are similar to that observed in synaptotagmin 1 mutants and following acute inactivation of synaptotagmin 1. This is worth citing since synaptic vesicle endocytosis is never directly assayed in the current study. 8) Figure 8C: \u201cThese data suggest that the AP2 complex plays a role in regulating the size of synaptic vesicles.\u201d Does the defect in vesicle size imply a role for determining the size of the vesicle? Many endocytic mutations alter vesicle size and it is unlikely that all participate in the control of vesicle diameter. An alternative conclusion is that any mutation that disrupts the fidelity of endocytosis may well disrupt the ability to reliably generate small vesicles of a consistent size.",

The converse pattern would be expected for cargos containing a tyrosine endocytic motif. In principle, these experiments could persuasively show that in mutants lacking specific subunits, the remaining AP2 subunits have the capacity to function as hemi-complexes. As suggested by the reviewers, we engineered CD4 with the di-leucine \u03b1-adaptin recognition motif and tested its localization in \u03b1 or \u03bc2 mutants. Consistent with the model, the substrate was strongly mislocalized in the apa-2 \u03b1 mutant, and weakly mislocalized in the apm-2 \u03bc2 mutant. Images are shown in Figure 5D and the quantification is shown in Figure 5E. For a \u03bc2 substrate, we used MIG-14 / wntless, which we have previously shown requires \u03bc2 for endocytosis from the surface. In reciprocal experiments we found that MIG-14 endocytosis is more defective in \u03bc2 mutants than \u03b1 mutants. Images are in Figure 5F and quantification in Figure 5G. Required textual revisions: 1) Please revise the text to make it as clear as possible how much residual AP2 function may exist in the hemi knockouts. In response to this request, we added two experiments to describe residual AP2 function in the mutants. First, we quantified the levels of remaining AP2 subunits by western blot in each of the mutants (depending on the availability of functional antibodies; Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1&2). Second, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of all four AP2 subunits at the nerve ring in \u03b1 and \u03bc2 mutants Figure 6 and Table 1). 2) Please discuss the contribution of hemi-complex function to the wild type animal, when all subunits are present. For example, AP2 binding to cargo endocytic motifs is activated by PIP2 binding, which is mediated by residues in both hemi-complexes. Clathrin recruitment by AP2 is mediated by clathrin binding sequences in both hemi-complexes. Native cargoes may contain motifs that bind both alpha and mu subunits.

In addition, the authors should comment on the observation that protein abundance for the residual hemi-complex is relatively low (e.g., in the apm-2 mutants), suggesting that it would be a minor contributor to wild-type endocytic activity. This is particularly the case if recruitment to the membrane is compromised for the hemi-complex. It is true, the holocomplex is likely to provide some inseparable functions, and even if completely stable, the function of a hemicomplex might be compromised. It is also important to note that the hemicomplexes are not fully stable. We now emphasize these two points in the new version of the Discussion. 3) Please revise the text to include p-values for all data upon which arguments or conclusions are based. This is particularly important for the diverse double mutant phenotypes that appear to trend toward significance, but which may or may not reach statistical significance. This is also the case when discussing comparisons being made regarding electrophysiological data. We double-checked our comparisons and have included all p-values in the legends of the figures or the figure supplements. To address the electrophysiological comparisons more precisely, we added the following text: \u201cIn apa-2(ox422) mutants, the amplitude from miniature spontaneously released vesicles (minis) is increased by 40% (Figure 9C). The mini amplitudes in the skin-rescued single and double mutants are also larger, although they do not reach statistical significance.\u201d 4) It is unclear why the authors did not report on the electrophysiological signature of the double (alpha/mu) mutant in the \u201cskin\u201d rescued animals. This is worth at least mentioning. The data for the skin-rescued double mutants are included in Figure 9. In the text we report the results as follows: \u201cThe double mutants exhibit a more severe, 42% reduction in the amplitude of the evoked responses (Figure 9E).\u201d \u201cThere is also a more severe reduction in the rates of tonic synaptic vesicle fusion. Skin-rescued apa-2 animals exhibit a 50% reduction in mini frequency, and the skin-rescued apa-2 apm-2 double mutants exhibit a 68% reduction in mini frequency (Figure 9D).\u201d 5) The authors should reference the mammalian work showing that loss of mu2 leads to loss of alpha and point out that this is in contrast to the findings in this system. We now note this difference in the Discussion. 6) It is not possible, at the light level, to know whether an altered axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution has anything to do with the recycling of individual proteins. This should be discussed. In C. elegans, stonin / UNC-41 (Mullen et al., 2012) and AP180 / UNC-11 (Nonet et al., 1999) are two characterized adaptors for synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin recycling at synapses. In the absence of these adaptors, the tagged cargo protein is severely diffused into axons that make the fluorescence at the synaptic varicosities decrease or even out with that in axons. So we still believe that the axon/synapse ratio of protein distribution could reflect the efficiency of the cargo recycling to some extent. To make this point clear in the paper, we have made the following change: \u201cIn C. elegans mutants lacking particular adaptor proteins, the cognate cargo protein diffuses into axons. For example in AP180 mutants, synaptobrevin is no longer concentrated at synapses but is diffuse in axons (Nonet et al., 1999). By contrast, in AP2 adaptin mutants, synaptic vesicle proteins are not grossly mislocalized.\u201d 7) The changes in vesicle size and number are similar to that observed in synaptotagmin 1 mutants and following acute inactivation of synaptotagmin 1. This is worth citing since synaptic vesicle endocytosis is never directly assayed in the current study. That is correct: acute inactivation of synaptotagmin at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as well as chronic inactivation in C. elegans exhibits a similar phenotype as that found here for AP2 knockouts. Moreover, we previously found that stonin shares overlapping functions with AP2. We now discuss the relationship among synaptotagmin, AP2 and stoning in the Discussion. 8) Figure 8C: \u201cThese data suggest that the AP2 complex plays a role in regulating the size of synaptic vesicles.\u201d Does the defect in vesicle size imply a role for determining the size of the vesicle? Many endocytic mutations alter vesicle size and it is unlikely that all participate in the control of vesicle diameter. An alternative conclusion is that any mutation that disrupts the fidelity of endocytosis may well disrupt the ability to reliably generate small vesicles of a consistent size. We have amended the text to state that the change in vesicle diameter might be indirect. In addition, to try to pinpoint where the defect in AP2 mutants might lie, we analyzed more sections and performed a 3D reconstruction of a synapse from the apa-2 apm-2 double mutant. Defects are observed at the cell membrane in some cases, but the most prominent defects are large vacuoles present in the synaptic varicosity. We speculate that AP2 might have a late role in the regeneration of synaptic vesicles from endosomes. The changes are as follows: Results, \u201cThese data suggest that the AP2 complex may play a role in regulating the size of synaptic vesicles. Alternatively, the effect on vesicle size may be indirect due to pleiotropic defects in endocytosis.\u201d Discussion, \u201cThe most prominent defect observed in AP2 mutants is the presence of large diameter vesicles and vacuoles in the synapses of the \u03b1-\u03bc2 adaptin double mutants. [\u2026] These data suggest that AP2 has a late function and possibly AP2 is required to regenerate synaptic vesicles from endosomes.\u201d",
