"<p>How are new genes created? Most of the mutations in the genome of an organism place the organism at some sort of disadvantage, but a small number confer an advantage. The beneficial changes are usually retained by subsequent generations and can ultimately lead to the creation of new genes.</p><p>An example is the gene that encodes an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This enzyme is involved in anaerobic respiration, the process that allows organisms to produce energy without using oxygen. The LDH enzyme is found in many species of animals and parasites, including those that spread malaria and other diseases. However, there are important differences in the structures of the LDH enzyme in animals and some parasites, like the malarial <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, because the genes for the enzymes in these two groups evolved separately.</p><p>The parasite version of the LDH enzyme evolved hundreds of millions of years ago from an enzyme with a similar structure called malate dehydrogenase, which was inherited from bacteria. To work out how the LDH enzyme developed, Boucher et al. predicted and built the ancestral proteins that would have formed as the bacterial enzyme evolved into LDH.</p><p>Studying these structures revealed that two mutations were mainly responsible for this evolution: six amino acids were added to the active site of the enzyme, and one amino acid (at position 102) was replaced by a different amino acid. However, introducing the same mutations into a modern version of the bacterial enzyme did not produce a working form of the LDH enzyme. This suggests that other amino acids, further away from the active site, also influenced how LDH evolved.</p><p>The structures found by Boucher et al. reveal that the enzymes evolved as a result of a gene duplicating, followed by one of the copies evolving a new function. However, some of the mutations responsible for the novel function occurred far from the active site, and it is still unknown how they exert their functional effects. Untangling the important mutations from the mundane will be necessary to fully understand how protein functions are created and how to control them\u2014both of which will aid in developing effective drugs that target essential parasite proteins.</p>"
