"Bacterially-produced small molecules exert profound influences on animal health,\n                    morphogenesis, and evolution through poorly understood mechanisms. In one of the\n                    closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca\n                        rosetta, we find that colony development is induced by the prey\n                    bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis and its close relatives\n                    in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1)\n                    produced by A. machipongonensis belongs to the small class of\n                    sulfonolipids, obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play\n                    important roles in signal transmission in plants, animals and fungi. RIF-1 has\n                    extraordinary potency (femtomolar, or 10-15M) and S.\n                        rosetta can respond to it over a broad dynamic range - nine orders\n                    of magnitude. This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial\n                    sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular\n                    mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of\n                    animals.
