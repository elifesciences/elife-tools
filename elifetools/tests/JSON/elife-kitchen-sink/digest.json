"Humans and other animals evolved in a world filled with bacteria, and bacteria\n                    have influenced the evolution of animals and humans. Although bacteria are most\n                    familiar as pathogens, they also produce small molecules that animals and other\n                    eukaryotes need, although the details of these beneficial effects are not well\n                    understood. The choanoflagellates are water-dwelling organisms that use their whip-like\n                    flagella to move around, feeding on bacteria. They can exist as one cell or a\n                    colony of multiple cells and, perhaps surprisingly, are the closest known living\n                    relatives of animals. This means that experiments on these organisms have the\n                    potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition\n                    from egg to embryo to adult. Alegado et al. have explored how the morphology of\n                        Salpingoeca rosetta, a colony-forming choanoflagellate, is\n                    influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria. In particular,\n                    they find that the development of multicellularity in S.\n                        rosettais triggered by the presence of the bacterium\n                        Algoriphagus machipongonensis as well as its close\n                    relatives. They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to\n                    be C32H64NO7S; this lipid molecule is an\n                    obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in\n                    signal transmission in animals, plants, and fungi. Moreover, Alegado et\n                        al. show that S. rosetta can respond to this\n                    molecule - which they call rosette-inducing factor (RIF-1) - over a wide range\n                    of concentrations, including concentrations as low as 10-17M. The work of Alegado et al. suggests that interactions between\n                        S. rosetta and Algoriphagus bacteria could\n                    be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal\n                    cell biology and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and\n                    reception. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open\n                    the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of\n                    multicellularity in animals."
