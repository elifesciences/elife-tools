"AcknowledgementsThis article is dedicated to the memory of the late Klaus Sander (1929-2015), who discovered anteriorposterior morphogen gradients in insects and the regulative patterning along the DV axis. His experiments provided the main motivation for the research conducted in SR\u2019s lab, leading to the current paper.\u00a0We thank Rodrigo Nunes da Fonseca for comments and discussions and are grateful to Waldemar Wojciech and Matt Benton for suggestions, corrections and help with Figure 1.
