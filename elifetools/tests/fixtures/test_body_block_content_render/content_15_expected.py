This experiment assessed whether there were alterations in viral load related to the PCR assay or collection technique. Only small changes occurred during 5-min intervals (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1A</a>, <a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, <a href="#SD1-data">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The mean absolute value of viral DNA copy difference between successive swabs was 0.20, 0.28, and 0.34 log<sub>10</sub> genomic copies in the three participants, and generally increased with time between swabs (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1B</a>, <a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The mean difference in HSV DNA copies between swabs correlated tightly with time between swabs in two participants (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a>, <a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), with virtually no difference in viral quantity between swabs separated by 5-min intervals in all three subjects (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a>, <a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Two episodes had negative mean differences in viral quantity with increasing time between swabs (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1C</a> , <a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), while one episode had a slightly positive mean difference (<a href="#fig1s1">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), suggesting that we captured two episodes during a decay phase and one episode near a peak of viral production. The standard deviation of the mean absolute value of viral DNA copy difference between successive swabs was 0.16, 0.22, and 0.26 in the three participants, respectively, suggesting that differences of &gt;0.5 log<sub>10</sub> HSV-2 DNA copies that may occur over hours usually reflect true changes in viral load rather than noise in the data attributable to clinical collection or PCR technique.',
