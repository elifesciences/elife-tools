expected = "<p>Bacterially-produced small molecules exert profound influences on animal health, morphogenesis, and evolution through poorly understood mechanisms. In one of the closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic>, we find that rosette colony development is induced by the prey bacterium <italic>Algoriphagus machipongonensis</italic> and its close relatives in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1) produced by <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> belongs to the small class of sulfonolipids, obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play important roles in signal transmission in plants, animals, and fungi. RIF-1 has extraordinary potency (femtomolar, or 10<sup>−15</sup> M) and <italic>S. rosetta</italic> can respond to it over a broad dynamic range—nine orders of magnitude. This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of animals.</p>"
